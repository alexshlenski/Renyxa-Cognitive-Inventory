[NKREA|000B]Summary  
[NKREA|000C]Since the late 1980s,
[NKREA|000D]when U.S. officials became aware
[NKREA|000E]that North Korea was actively
[NKREA|000F]pursuing  nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0010]capabilities, U.S. administrations
[NKREA|0011]have used a combination
[NKREA|0012]of pressure,  deterrence,
[NKREA|0013]and diplomacy to try to
[NKREA|0014]reduce the threat
[NKREA|0015]posed by a
[NKREA|0016]nuclear-armed North Korea.


[NKREA|0017]The  need
[NKREA|0018]for an effective North Korea
[NKREA|0019]strategy has become
[NKREA|001A]more pressing over
[NKREA|001B]the past decade,
[NKREA|001C]as  Pyongyang
[NKREA|001D]has made advances in its
[NKREA|001E]nuclear weapons and missile programs.


[NKREA|001F]Shortly after 
[NKREA|0020]assuming office, the Biden Administration
[NKREA|0021]conducted a review
[NKREA|0022]of U.S. policy toward North
[NKREA|0023]Korea, deciding that it
[NKREA|0024]will engage in
[NKREA|0025]a “calibrated, practical approach that
[NKREA|0026]is open to
[NKREA|0027]and will  explore
[NKREA|0028]diplomacy” with North Korea
[NKREA|0029]with a goal
[NKREA|002A]of achieving its eventual “complete
[NKREA|002B]denuclearization.” The Administration hopes to
[NKREA|002C]accomplish this end
[NKREA|002D]by seeking “practical 
[NKREA|002E]measures that can help ...
[NKREA|002F]make progress along
[NKREA|0030]the way towards that goal.”
[NKREA|0031]The approach appears 
[NKREA|0032]to envision offering partial sanctions
[NKREA|0033]relief in exchange
[NKREA|0034]for partial steps toward denuclearization.


[NKREA|0035]Biden Administration officials
[NKREA|0036]say they have
[NKREA|0037]reached out to North Korea,
[NKREA|0038]offering to meet 
[NKREA|0039]“without preconditions,” and
[NKREA|003A]say Pyongyang largely
[NKREA|003B]has ignored U.S. outreach,
[NKREA|003C]including offers 
[NKREA|003D]of humanitarian assistance
[NKREA|003E]and attempts to communicate.


[NKREA|003F]Meanwhile, since the last round
[NKREA|0040]of  U.S.-DPRK talks
[NKREA|0041]broke down in 2019, North
[NKREA|0042]Korea appears to
[NKREA|0043]have advanced key aspects
[NKREA|0044]of its  military
[NKREA|0045]capabilities, particularly in
[NKREA|0046]the reliability and precision
[NKREA|0047]of its missile forces.


[NKREA|0048]This report  summarizes
[NKREA|0049]past nuclear and missile negotiations
[NKREA|004A]between the United States
[NKREA|004B]and North Korea, 
[NKREA|004C]also known by its formal
[NKREA|004D]name, the Democratic People’s Republic
[NKREA|004E]of Korea (DPRK),
[NKREA|004F]and  highlights some
[NKREA|0050]of the lessons
[NKREA|0051]and implications from these efforts.


[NKREA|0052]The United States
[NKREA|0053]has engaged in five major
[NKREA|0054]sets of formal nuclear
[NKREA|0055]and missile negotiations
[NKREA|0056]with  North Korea:
[NKREA|0057]the bilateral Agreed Framework (1994-2002),
[NKREA|0058]bilateral missile negotiations (1996- 
[NKREA|0059]2000), the multilateral Six-Party Talks
[NKREA|005A](2003-2009), the bilateral Leap Day
[NKREA|005B]Deal (2012), and top- 
[NKREA|005C]level summit meetings
[NKREA|005D]and letter exchanges between President
[NKREA|005E]Donald Trump and North Korean
[NKREA|005F]leader Kim Jong Un (2018-2019).


[NKREA|0060]In general, the formula
[NKREA|0061]for these negotiations
[NKREA|0062]has been for 
[NKREA|0063]North Korea to halt,
[NKREA|0064]and in some cases disable,
[NKREA|0065]its nuclear or missile programs
[NKREA|0066]in return for 
[NKREA|0067]economic and diplomatic incentives,
[NKREA|0068]including the promise
[NKREA|0069]of better U.S.-DPRK relations
[NKREA|006A]and of 
[NKREA|006B]a formal end to
[NKREA|006C]the Korean War.


[NKREA|006D]All five diplomatic efforts
[NKREA|006E]resulted in an agreement;


[NKREA|006F]two—the 
[NKREA|0070]Agreed Framework and
[NKREA|0071]the Six-Party Talks—produced tangible reductions
[NKREA|0072]in North Korea’s 
[NKREA|0073]existing capabilities.


[NKREA|0074]Even those achievements
[NKREA|0075]proved fleeting when
[NKREA|0076]the two agreements 
[NKREA|0077]eventually collapsed.


[NKREA|0078]Congress possesses a number
[NKREA|0079]of tools to influence
[NKREA|007A]how the Administration pursues negotiations
[NKREA|007B]with North Korea,
[NKREA|007C]including oversight hearings, resolutions
[NKREA|007D]expressing congressional sentiment, 
[NKREA|007E]restrictions and conditions on
[NKREA|007F]the use of funds
[NKREA|0080]for negotiations and diplomacy through
[NKREA|0081]the  appropriations process,
[NKREA|0082]and legislation that attaches
[NKREA|0083]or relaxes conditions
[NKREA|0084]and requirements for 
[NKREA|0085]implementation of agreements.


[NKREA|0086]Past Congresses have
[NKREA|0087]influenced U.S.-DPRK talks
[NKREA|0088]and in several 
[NKREA|0089]cases affected the implementation
[NKREA|008A]of the negotiated agreements.


[NKREA|008B]Congress’s role, by way
[NKREA|008C]of 
[NKREA|008D]appropriating funds, has been particularly
[NKREA|008E]significant in negotiations
[NKREA|008F]over the United States 
[NKREA|0090]providing energy and humanitarian assistance
[NKREA|0091]to North Korea.

[NKREA|0101]Introduction  
[NKREA|0102]Over the past decade, North
[NKREA|0103]Korea has made significant advances
[NKREA|0104]in its nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0105]and  missile programs,
[NKREA|0106]dramatically raising the threat Pyongyang
[NKREA|0107]poses to the
[NKREA|0108]United States homeland, 
[NKREA|0109]U.S. allies in East Asia,
[NKREA|010A]and U.S. interests.


[NKREA|010B]One of the options
[NKREA|010C]the Biden Administration may 
[NKREA|010D]choose to pursue,
[NKREA|010E]and Members of Congress may
[NKREA|010F]choose to promote, is an
[NKREA|0110]aggressive negotiation  strategy
[NKREA|0111]to address the North Korean
[NKREA|0112]challenge.


[NKREA|0113]Shortly after President Joe Biden’s
[NKREA|0114]inauguration,  his Administration
[NKREA|0115]launched a North Korean policy
[NKREA|0116]review.


[NKREA|0117]In late April 2021,
[NKREA|0118]the Administration 
[NKREA|0119]announced that it
[NKREA|011A]had completed its review,
[NKREA|011B]and that it
[NKREA|011C]will be a “calibrated, practical
[NKREA|011D]approach  that is
[NKREA|011E]open to and
[NKREA|011F]will explore diplomacy
[NKREA|0120]with North Korea” to achieve
[NKREA|0121]eventually the “complete 
[NKREA|0122]denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”
[NKREA|0123]even as U.S.
[NKREA|0124]and international sanctions remain in
[NKREA|0125]place.1 The approach appears to
[NKREA|0126]envision offering partial sanctions relief
[NKREA|0127]in exchange for partial 
[NKREA|0128]steps toward denuclearization.


[NKREA|0129]President Biden has
[NKREA|012A]appointed Ambassador and former Deputy
[NKREA|012B]Assistant Secretary of State
[NKREA|012C]for Japan and
[NKREA|012D]the Koreas Sung Kim
[NKREA|012E]as a part-time Special 
[NKREA|012F]Representative for North Korea Policy
[NKREA|0130](he concurrently serves
[NKREA|0131]as U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia).


[NKREA|0132]Biden Administration officials
[NKREA|0133]say they have
[NKREA|0134]reached out to North Korea,
[NKREA|0135]offering to meet 
[NKREA|0136]“without preconditions,” and that North
[NKREA|0137]Korea largely has
[NKREA|0138]ignored these offers,
[NKREA|0139]as well as offers 
[NKREA|013A]of humanitarian aid from
[NKREA|013B]the United States
[NKREA|013C]and South Korea.2

[NKREA|0158]3 Over the
[NKREA|0159]past three decades, U.S.

[NKREA|015B]have engaged in numerous informal
[NKREA|015C]contacts, as have U.S. 
[NKREA|015D]scholars and think-tank representatives in
[NKREA|015E]supporting roles to track-II diplomacy.

[NKREA|0176]past formal nuclear
[NKREA|0177]and missile negotiations between
[NKREA|0178]the United States 
[NKREA|0179]and North Korea,
[NKREA|017A]also known by its official
[NKREA|017B]name, the Democratic People’s Republic
[NKREA|017C]of Korea  (DPRK),
[NKREA|017D]and highlights some
[NKREA|017E]of the lessons
[NKREA|017F]and implications that
[NKREA|0180]can be drawn from these
[NKREA|0181]efforts, particularly on
[NKREA|0182]the questions of utility, timing,
[NKREA|0183]scope, and goals
[NKREA|0184]of negotiating with
[NKREA|0185]the  DPRK.3 
[NKREA|0186]During his presidency, Donald Trump
[NKREA|0187]adopted a previously
[NKREA|0188]untried approach to
[NKREA|0189]negotiating with  North
[NKREA|018A]Korea.


[NKREA|018B]Eschewing the traditional practice
[NKREA|018C]of prioritizing working-level talks, Trump
[NKREA|018D]opted 
[NKREA|018E]for a top-down style that
[NKREA|018F]led to three leader-to-leader meetings
[NKREA|0190]with North Korea’s Kim Jong
[NKREA|0191]Un  between June
[NKREA|0192]2018 and June 2019.


[NKREA|0193]Although tensions surrounding
[NKREA|0194]the Korean Peninsula
[NKREA|0195]ebbed 
[NKREA|0196]during the leader-level rapprochement, President
[NKREA|0197]Trump’s approach did
[NKREA|0198]not produce reductions in 
[NKREA|0199]North Korea’s nuclear
[NKREA|019A]or missile programs,
[NKREA|019B]which continued to advance,
[NKREA|019C]and led to criticism that
[NKREA|019D]he weakened U.S. alliance commitments
[NKREA|019E]to South Korea
[NKREA|019F]and Japan.4 In contrast,
[NKREA|01A0]during the 2020 
[NKREA|01A1]presidential campaign, President Biden
[NKREA|01A2]said he would emphasize alliance
[NKREA|01A3]coordination in his 
[NKREA|01A4]North Korea approach.


[NKREA|01A5]He also criticized Trump’s decisions
[NKREA|01A6]to meet with Kim
[NKREA|01A7]without first 
[NKREA|01A8]obtaining more concrete commitments to
[NKREA|01A9]denuclearize, if not actual reductions.5

[NKREA|01B1]Upon assuming the presidency, Biden

[NKREA|01E2]Congress has tools to influence
[NKREA|01E3]whether and how
[NKREA|01E4]the Biden Administration pursues negotiations
[NKREA|01E5]with North Korea,
[NKREA|01E6]including oversight hearings, resolutions
[NKREA|01E7]expressing congressional sentiment, 
[NKREA|01E8]restrictions on appropriations that fund
[NKREA|01E9]negotiations and diplomacy,
[NKREA|01EA]and legislation that attaches 
[NKREA|01EB]or relaxes conditions
[NKREA|01EC]and requirements for implementation
[NKREA|01ED]of agreements.


[NKREA|01EE]Congress has 
[NKREA|01EF]influenced past U.S.-DPRK talks
[NKREA|01F0]and in several cases
[NKREA|01F1]affected the implementation
[NKREA|01F2]of the 
[NKREA|01F3]negotiated agreements.


[NKREA|01F4]Congress’s role has been particularly
[NKREA|01F5]significant in shaping U.S. policy
[NKREA|01F6]related to the provision
[NKREA|01F7]of energy and humanitarian assistance
[NKREA|01F8]to North Korea.


[NKREA|01F9]Congressional  measures
[NKREA|01FA]expanding and tightening U.S. sanctions
[NKREA|01FB]against North Korea directly affect
[NKREA|01FC]U.S.  presidents’ flexibility
[NKREA|01FD]in negotiating with North Korea.


[NKREA|01FE]In particular, since 2016 Congress
[NKREA|01FF]has 
[NKREA|0200]passed sanctions legislation
[NKREA|0201]establishing requirements that
[NKREA|0202]must be met
[NKREA|0203]before the president
[NKREA|0204]can  suspend
[NKREA|0205]or terminate DPRK sanctions,
[NKREA|0206]as well as explicitly
[NKREA|0207]making some sanctions ineligible
[NKREA|0208]for 
[NKREA|0209]temporary waivers.6  
[NKREA|020A]Nuclear and Missile Negotiations from
[NKREA|020B]1994 to 2020 
[NKREA|020C]Since the early 1990s, successive
[NKREA|020D]U.S. Presidents have
[NKREA|020E]faced the question
[NKREA|020F]of whether and
[NKREA|0210]how to  negotiate
[NKREA|0211]with the North Korean government
[NKREA|0212]to halt Pyongyang’s nuclear program
[NKREA|0213]and  ambitions.7 In
[NKREA|0214]general, the formula
[NKREA|0215]for these negotiations
[NKREA|0216]involved North Korea
[NKREA|0217]halting or 
[NKREA|0218]dismantling its nuclear
[NKREA|0219]or missile programs in return
[NKREA|021A]for economic and diplomatic incentives.


[NKREA|021B]The 
[NKREA|021C]United States and North Korea
[NKREA|021D]have engaged in five major
[NKREA|021E]sets of formal negotiations: talks
[NKREA|021F]that 
[NKREA|0220]resulted in the bilateral
[NKREA|0221]Agreed Framework (in place from
[NKREA|0222]1994 until 2002), bilateral missile
[NKREA|0223]negotiations (1996-2000), multilateral Six-Party Talks
[NKREA|0224](2003-2009), the bilateral Leap Day
[NKREA|0225]Deal  (2012),
[NKREA|0226]and top-level summit meetings
[NKREA|0227]and letter exchanges between President
[NKREA|0228]Donald Trump 
[NKREA|0229]and North Korean leader Kim
[NKREA|022A]Jong Un (2018-2019).


[NKREA|022B]The Agreed Framework (1994-2002) 
[NKREA|022C]Background: Negotiations to Defuse
[NKREA|022D]the First Nuclear Crisis 
[NKREA|022E]Pyongyang joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation
[NKREA|022F]Treaty (NPT) as
[NKREA|0230]a nonnuclear weapon state in
[NKREA|0231]1985, in response to Soviet
[NKREA|0232]pressure, and agreed to allow
[NKREA|0233]inspections of its nuclear facilities
[NKREA|0234]by 
[NKREA|0235]the International Atomic Energy Agency
[NKREA|0236](IAEA).


[NKREA|0237]Evidence had surfaced in
[NKREA|0238]the 1980s that North 
[NKREA|0239]Korea was engaged in
[NKREA|023A]a clandestine nuclear weapons development
[NKREA|023B]effort.8 In 1992,
[NKREA|023C]the DPRK 
[NKREA|023D]submitted its declaration
[NKREA|023E]of nuclear facilities
[NKREA|023F]and materials to
[NKREA|0240]the IAEA, which was to
[NKREA|0241]verify the  statement’s
[NKREA|0242]accuracy and completeness.


[NKREA|0243]8 North Korea built
[NKREA|0244]several facilities for plutonium production
[NKREA|0245]in the 1980s,
[NKREA|0246]including a plutonium separation plant
[NKREA|0247]and 
[NKREA|0248]graphite-moderated reactor.

[NKREA|0261]The first nuclear crisis was
[NKREA|0262]triggered in February 1993,
[NKREA|0263]when the IAEA
[NKREA|0264]demanded inspections of 
[NKREA|0265]two undeclared sites that it
[NKREA|0266]suspected were nuclear waste storage
[NKREA|0267]depots.


[NKREA|0268]North Korea refused 
[NKREA|0269]inspections and declared that it
[NKREA|026A]would withdraw from
[NKREA|026B]the NPT, leading to
[NKREA|026C]over a year
[NKREA|026D]of  negotiations between
[NKREA|026E]North Korea, on one side,
[NKREA|026F]and the United States
[NKREA|0270]and the IAEA on
[NKREA|0271]the other.


[NKREA|0272]These talks produced multiple joint
[NKREA|0273]statements and agreements, none
[NKREA|0274]of which held
[NKREA|0275]for more than 
[NKREA|0276]several months, centering around North
[NKREA|0277]Korea allowing IAEA inspectors access
[NKREA|0278]to the disputed 
[NKREA|0279]facilities in exchange
[NKREA|027A]for U.S. guarantees
[NKREA|027B]not to attack
[NKREA|027C](referred to as “security assurances”),
[NKREA|027D]and  possible civil-use
[NKREA|027E]energy assistance.


[NKREA|027F]U.S. estimates say North Korea
[NKREA|0280]had separated enough 
[NKREA|0281]plutonium for one
[NKREA|0282]or two bombs.9 Then-U.S.


[NKREA|0283]Secretary of Defense William J.
[NKREA|0284]Perry described the 
[NKREA|0285]Clinton Administration policy
[NKREA|0286]as “coercive diplomacy” under
[NKREA|0287]which offers for talks were
[NKREA|0288]“backed 
[NKREA|0289]with a very credible threat
[NKREA|028A]of military force.”10
[NKREA|028B]The Clinton Administration
[NKREA|028C]considered conducting 
[NKREA|028D]a military strike against
[NKREA|028E]the DPRK’s Yongbyon nuclear facility,
[NKREA|028F]where the plutonium-based 
[NKREA|0290]nuclear facilities were located.11 
[NKREA|0291]The crisis was
[NKREA|0292]defused in June 1993,
[NKREA|0293]when former President Jimmy Carter
[NKREA|0294]traveled to Pyongyang 
[NKREA|0295]and brokered the outlines
[NKREA|0296]of a deal—backed
[NKREA|0297]by the Clinton Administration—with North
[NKREA|0298]Korean  leader Kim
[NKREA|0299]Il-sung.


[NKREA|029A]North Korea agreed to freeze
[NKREA|029B]its plutonium production program in
[NKREA|029C]exchange 
[NKREA|029D]for a light-water nuclear power
[NKREA|029E]reactor, to be
[NKREA|029F]provided by the
[NKREA|02A0]United States, and
[NKREA|02A1]a move toward 
[NKREA|02A2]normalized diplomatic and economic relations
[NKREA|02A3]between the two nations.


[NKREA|02A4]Kim Il-sung died in July
[NKREA|02A5]1994, but bilateral negotiations
[NKREA|02A6]continued under his successor
[NKREA|02A7]and son, Kim Jong-il.


[NKREA|02A8]The nuclear talks
[NKREA|02A9]during the early 1990s took
[NKREA|02AA]place against a backdrop
[NKREA|02AB]of a worsened geopolitical 
[NKREA|02AC]and economic situation
[NKREA|02AD]for Pyongyang.


[NKREA|02AE]The easing of Cold War
[NKREA|02AF]hostilities and subsequent 
[NKREA|02B0]collapse of the Soviet bloc
[NKREA|02B1]provided an opening
[NKREA|02B2]for South Korea, under President
[NKREA|02B3]Roh Tae-woo’s  “Nordpolitik”
[NKREA|02B4](northern policy), to establish relations
[NKREA|02B5]in 1990 and 1992
[NKREA|02B6]with Moscow and 
[NKREA|02B7]Beijing, respectively.


[NKREA|02B8]Over the same period,
[NKREA|02B9]a collapse in economic support
[NKREA|02BA]from the Soviet 
[NKREA|02BB]Union and China,
[NKREA|02BC]which for decades
[NKREA|02BD]had provided the DPRK
[NKREA|02BE]with significant assistance
[NKREA|02BF]and  concessional trade,
[NKREA|02C0]produced economic hardship inside North
[NKREA|02C1]Korea that ultimately
[NKREA|02C2]contributed to 
[NKREA|02C3]a massive famine
[NKREA|02C4]later in the decade.


[NKREA|02C5]Additionally, the end
[NKREA|02C6]of the Cold War led
[NKREA|02C7]the United States 
[NKREA|02C8]to announce in 1991 that
[NKREA|02C9]it would withdraw all
[NKREA|02CA]of its land-based tactical nuclear
[NKREA|02CB]weapons from  overseas
[NKREA|02CC]bases, including those in South
[NKREA|02CD]Korea.


[NKREA|02CE]These were among
[NKREA|02CF]the factors that appear to
[NKREA|02D0]have  both
[NKREA|02D1]pressured and encouraged Kim Il-sung
[NKREA|02D2]and Kim Jong-il to seek
[NKREA|02D3]a new and
[NKREA|02D4]improved  relationship
[NKREA|02D5]with the West,
[NKREA|02D6]including on nuclear issues.


[NKREA|02D7]In 1992, the two Koreas
[NKREA|02D8]negotiated the  Joint
[NKREA|02D9]Declaration of the Denuclearization
[NKREA|02DA]of the Korean Peninsula in
[NKREA|02DB]which the two sides
[NKREA|02DC]said  they “shall
[NKREA|02DD]not test, manufacture, produce, receive,
[NKREA|02DE]possess, store, deploy
[NKREA|02DF]or use nuclear 
[NKREA|02E0]weapons” and would create
[NKREA|02E1]the conditions for “peaceful reunification.”12
[NKREA|02E2]The Agreed Framework 
[NKREA|02E3]Three months after Kim Il-sung’s
[NKREA|02E4]death, U.S.-DPRK nuclear talks
[NKREA|02E5]culminated in the October 
[NKREA|02E6]1994 Agreed Framework,
[NKREA|02E7]which committed North Korea to
[NKREA|02E8]remain a party to
[NKREA|02E9]the NPT, freeze its 
[NKREA|02EA]plutonium production programs,
[NKREA|02EB]and eventually dismantle them under
[NKREA|02EC]international inspection in 
[NKREA|02ED]return for energy assistance from
[NKREA|02EE]the United States
[NKREA|02EF]and other countries.13 Under
[NKREA|02F0]the agreement, 
[NKREA|02F1]the DPRK would receive two
[NKREA|02F2]nuclear-powered light-water reactors (LWRs).


[NKREA|02F3]North Korea 
[NKREA|02F4]complied with the plutonium freeze
[NKREA|02F5]terms of the
[NKREA|02F6]Agreed Framework, allowing IAEA verification
[NKREA|02F7]tools to be
[NKREA|02F8]installed—including the “canning”
[NKREA|02F9]of spent fuel rods at
[NKREA|02FA]the Yongbyon reactor—and 
[NKREA|02FB]consented to permanent remote
[NKREA|02FC]monitoring and inspectors at its
[NKREA|02FD]nuclear facilities.


[NKREA|02FE]The Agreed  Framework
[NKREA|02FF]also stated that
[NKREA|0300]the United States “will provide
[NKREA|0301]formal assurances to
[NKREA|0302]the DPRK  against
[NKREA|0303]the threat or use
[NKREA|0304]of nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0305]by the U.S.”14 Both North
[NKREA|0306]Korea and the
[NKREA|0307]United  States
[NKREA|0308]committed to political
[NKREA|0309]and economic normalization.


[NKREA|030A]The Agreed Framework
[NKREA|030B]also laid the 
[NKREA|030C]groundwork for U.S. energy assistance
[NKREA|030D]and improved economic
[NKREA|030E]relations—including the easing 
[NKREA|030F]of U.S. sanctions.

[NKREA|0355]The Agreed Framework
[NKREA|0356]called for 500,000 metric tons
[NKREA|0357]of heavy fuel oil (HFO)
[NKREA|0358]to be provided to 
[NKREA|0359]North Korea annually
[NKREA|035A]while the two LWRs were
[NKREA|035B]constructed, through the Korean Peninsula
[NKREA|035C]Energy Development Organization (KEDO),
[NKREA|035D]a consortium formed
[NKREA|035E]by the United States, Japan,
[NKREA|035F]and South Korea.15 From 1995
[NKREA|0360]to 2002, Congress
[NKREA|0361]appropriated funds for
[NKREA|0362]over $400 million in 
[NKREA|0363]energy assistance to North Korea
[NKREA|0364]through KEDO.16 U.S. contributions
[NKREA|0365]covered heavy fuel oil 
[NKREA|0366]shipments and KEDO administrative costs.


[NKREA|0367]South Korea and Japan
[NKREA|0368]funded the bulk
[NKREA|0369]of the LWR 
[NKREA|036A]construction costs.17 Supplying North Korea
[NKREA|036B]with a nuclear power plant
[NKREA|036C]was controversial in 
[NKREA|036D]Congress, particularly after Republicans took
[NKREA|036E]control of the House
[NKREA|036F]of Representatives in 1995.


[NKREA|0370]Starting in 1998, Congress
[NKREA|0371]required the President to certify
[NKREA|0372]progress in nuclear
[NKREA|0373]and missile  negotiations
[NKREA|0374]before allocating money to KEDO
[NKREA|0375]operations.


[NKREA|0376]The Clinton Administration
[NKREA|0377]viewed  this conditionality
[NKREA|0378]as fatal to
[NKREA|0379]the Agreed Framework,
[NKREA|037A]and disagreements between
[NKREA|037B]the  Administration
[NKREA|037C]and Congress almost
[NKREA|037D]prevented the KEDO
[NKREA|037E]funding from being
[NKREA|037F]appropriated in  multiple
[NKREA|0380]years.18  
[NKREA|0381]In August 1998,
[NKREA|0382]when North Korea
[NKREA|0383]tested its first long-range ballistic
[NKREA|0384]missile over Japan, there 
[NKREA|0385]were calls in Congress to
[NKREA|0386]end the Agreed Framework.


[NKREA|0387]The Clinton Administration
[NKREA|0388]conducted a  policy
[NKREA|0389]review, coordinated by former Secretary
[NKREA|038A]of Defense William Perry,
[NKREA|038B]which concluded that 
[NKREA|038C]although the Agreed Framework
[NKREA|038D]had stopped plutonium production, North
[NKREA|038E]Korea had likely 
[NKREA|038F]continued its nuclear
[NKREA|0390]weapons-related work and
[NKREA|0391]had developed and

[NKREA|03CD]U.S.-DPRK Missile Negotiations 
[NKREA|03CE]Beginning in 1996,
[NKREA|03CF]the Clinton Administration
[NKREA|03D0]pursued a series
[NKREA|03D1]of negotiations with North Korea
[NKREA|03D2]focused on curbing
[NKREA|03D3]the DPRK’s missile program
[NKREA|03D4]and ending its missile exports,
[NKREA|03D5]particularly to  countries
[NKREA|03D6]in the Middle East.20
[NKREA|03D7]The policy review’s conclusions gave
[NKREA|03D8]added emphasis to these 
[NKREA|03D9]efforts.


[NKREA|03DA]In September 1999, North Korea
[NKREA|03DB]agreed to a moratorium on
[NKREA|03DC]testing long-range missiles in 
[NKREA|03DD]exchange for the partial
[NKREA|03DE]lifting of U.S. sanctions
[NKREA|03DF]and a continuation
[NKREA|03E0]of bilateral talks.


[NKREA|03E1](North  Korea
[NKREA|03E2]maintained its moratorium
[NKREA|03E3]until July 2006.) In December
[NKREA|03E4]1999, KEDO signed
[NKREA|03E5]a contract to 
[NKREA|03E6]begin construction of two LWRs.


[NKREA|03E7]Separately, in a sign
[NKREA|03E8]of an improved
[NKREA|03E9]overall negotiating climate
[NKREA|03EA]with Pyongyang, North
[NKREA|03EB]and South  Korea
[NKREA|03EC]held their first-ever summit in
[NKREA|03ED]June 2000 and began
[NKREA|03EE]implementing initiatives aimed at 
[NKREA|03EF]improving relations.21 North Korea was
[NKREA|03F0]suffering from a widespread famine
[NKREA|03F1]at the time,
[NKREA|03F2]which  may
[NKREA|03F3]have motivated Pyongyang to engage
[NKREA|03F4]internationally.


[NKREA|03F5]Then-Secretary of State Madeleine 
[NKREA|03F6]Albright visited Pyongyang in October
[NKREA|03F7]2000 to finalize
[NKREA|03F8]the terms of
[NKREA|03F9]a new agreement, under 
[NKREA|03FA]which North Korea
[NKREA|03FB]would end ballistic missile development
[NKREA|03FC]and all missile exports in
[NKREA|03FD]exchange 
[NKREA|03FE]for international assistance in
[NKREA|03FF]launching North Korean satellites.


[NKREA|0400]Reportedly, if final details
[NKREA|0401]had  been reached,
[NKREA|0402]a framework agreement
[NKREA|0403]would have been
[NKREA|0404]signed in Pyongyang between President
[NKREA|0405]Bill Clinton and Kim Jong-il.


[NKREA|0406]However, the Clinton Administration
[NKREA|0407]decided the President
[NKREA|0408]would 
[NKREA|0409]not make the trip due,
[NKREA|040A]in part, to
[NKREA|040B]the disputed 2000 U.S. presidential
[NKREA|040C]election results, and talks 
[NKREA|040D]were not held
[NKREA|040E]before Clinton left office.22

[NKREA|0410]Background: The George W. Bush
[NKREA|0411]Administration and the
[NKREA|0412]Agreed Framework  
[NKREA|0413]Shortly after President George W.
[NKREA|0414]Bush took office in January
[NKREA|0415]2001, the new Administration 
[NKREA|0416]began a full review
[NKREA|0417]of U.S. policy toward North
[NKREA|0418]Korea, distancing itself from Clinton
[NKREA|0419]policies.


[NKREA|041A]The next two years
[NKREA|041B]would be marked
[NKREA|041C]by a mix
[NKREA|041D]of high-level diplomatic outreach
[NKREA|041E]and difficulties  in
[NKREA|041F]implementing the agreements already in
[NKREA|0420]place.


[NKREA|0421]Key members of
[NKREA|0422]the Administration and some 
[NKREA|0423]Members of Congress were
[NKREA|0424]opposed to continuing
[NKREA|0425]the Agreed Framework in its
[NKREA|0426]existing form.


[NKREA|0427]The Agreed Framework
[NKREA|0428]required Pyongyang to disclose fully
[NKREA|0429]its nuclear program,
[NKREA|042A]but North  Korea
[NKREA|042B]did not cooperate
[NKREA|042C]and the IAEA
[NKREA|042D]could not verify
[NKREA|042E]the completeness of North Korea’s
[NKREA|042F]report.


[NKREA|0430]In June 2001,
[NKREA|0431]the Administration announced that it
[NKREA|0432]would pursue “comprehensive” negotiations 
[NKREA|0433]that would include further
[NKREA|0434]lifting U.S. sanctions,
[NKREA|0435]providing humanitarian assistance,
[NKREA|0436]and “other  political
[NKREA|0437]steps” if the North
[NKREA|0438]agreed to verifiable steps to
[NKREA|0439]reduce its conventional military posture
[NKREA|043A]toward South Korea,
[NKREA|043B]“improved implementation” of
[NKREA|043C]the Agreed Framework,
[NKREA|043D]and accepted  “verifiable
[NKREA|043E]constraints” on its missile program
[NKREA|043F]and a ban on its
[NKREA|0440]missile exports.23

[NKREA|0473]In his January 2002 State
[NKREA|0474]of the Union address,
[NKREA|0475]the first since
[NKREA|0476]the September 11, 2001, terrorist
[NKREA|0477]attacks, President Bush
[NKREA|0478]grouped North Korea into an
[NKREA|0479]“axis of evil,” along
[NKREA|047A]with Iraq and Iran.24 
[NKREA|047B]The speech emphasized that
[NKREA|047C]the United States “must
[NKREA|047D]not permit the world’s
[NKREA|047E]most dangerous  regimes
[NKREA|047F]to threaten us
[NKREA|0480]with the world’s
[NKREA|0481]most destructive weapons.” In contrast
[NKREA|0482]to statements  about
[NKREA|0483]use of force in Iraq,
[NKREA|0484]however, in a February 2002
[NKREA|0485]speech in Seoul, President Bush
[NKREA|0486]said that 
[NKREA|0487]the United States
[NKREA|0488]had no intention
[NKREA|0489]of invading North Korea
[NKREA|048A]and was supportive
[NKREA|048B]of the South 
[NKREA|048C]Korean President’s “sunshine policy” that
[NKREA|048D]emphasized engagement.25 The
[NKREA|048E]United States and 
[NKREA|048F]North Korea scheduled talks
[NKREA|0490]for summer 2002,
[NKREA|0491]but they were
[NKREA|0492]postponed after a June 29,
[NKREA|0493]2002,  naval skirmish
[NKREA|0494]between North and South Korea
[NKREA|0495]in which 19 South Korean
[NKREA|0496]troops were killed.


[NKREA|0497]Meanwhile, the parties
[NKREA|0498]continued to implement
[NKREA|0499]the Agreed Framework;


[NKREA|049A]the concrete foundation 
[NKREA|049B]for the first LWR to
[NKREA|049C]be provided under

[NKREA|049F]with 
[NKREA|04A0]United States representative to KEDO
[NKREA|04A1](and special envoy
[NKREA|04A2]for negotiations with North Korea)
[NKREA|04A3]Jack  Pritchard present.


[NKREA|04A4]The United States
[NKREA|04A5]then urged North Korea to
[NKREA|04A6]cooperate with the IAEA on
[NKREA|04A7]verification, but North Korea
[NKREA|04A8]said it would
[NKREA|04A9]not do so
[NKREA|04AA]for another three years
[NKREA|04AB]and threatened to pull 
[NKREA|04AC]out of the
[NKREA|04AD]Agreed Framework altogether
[NKREA|04AE]if faster progress was
[NKREA|04AF]not made on reactor construction.


[NKREA|04B0]While construction of
[NKREA|04B1]the promised LWRs
[NKREA|04B2]had begun in February 2000,
[NKREA|04B3]no nuclear components 
[NKREA|04B4]could be delivered under
[NKREA|04B5]the terms of
[NKREA|04B6]the Agreed Framework
[NKREA|04B7]until the IAEA
[NKREA|04B8]verified the  completeness
[NKREA|04B9]of North Korea’s declaration.26 In
[NKREA|04BA]addition, delays in
[NKREA|04BB]raising funds, setting up
[NKREA|04BC]the  organization,
[NKREA|04BD]and concluding contracts
[NKREA|04BE]prevented KEDO from
[NKREA|04BF]meeting the original goal

[NKREA|04C1]constructing the first LWR

[NKREA|04C6]and Kim Jong-il,
[NKREA|04C7]raised hopes for resolution to
[NKREA|04C8]this and other issues.


[NKREA|04C9]In a document
[NKREA|04CA]signed with  Koizumi,
[NKREA|04CB]Kim renewed North Korea’s commitment
[NKREA|04CC]to a missile-testing moratorium in
[NKREA|04CD]September  2002, in
[NKREA|04CE]advance of a high-level visit
[NKREA|04CF]to Pyongyang by U.S. diplomats.28
[NKREA|04D0]A new crisis began in
[NKREA|04D1]October 2002.


[NKREA|04D2]During a visit to Pyongyang,
[NKREA|04D3]then-Assistant Secretary of 
[NKREA|04D4]State for East Asian
[NKREA|04D5]and Pacific Affairs James A.
[NKREA|04D6]Kelly reportedly presented
[NKREA|04D7]the North Koreans 
[NKREA|04D8]with evidence of
[NKREA|04D9]a clandestine highly
[NKREA|04DA]enriched uranium (HEU) production program
[NKREA|04DB]in North  Korea.


[NKREA|04DC]Plutonium or HEU
[NKREA|04DD]can be used
[NKREA|04DE]as fissile material
[NKREA|04DF]for a nuclear weapon.


[NKREA|04E0]According to the 
[NKREA|04E1]Bush Administration, North Korea
[NKREA|04E2]confirmed the allegations
[NKREA|04E3]and said the
[NKREA|04E4]Agreed Framework was 
[NKREA|04E5]nullified.


[NKREA|04E6]The United States, Japan,
[NKREA|04E7]and South Korea
[NKREA|04E8]issued a trilateral statement

[NKREA|051C]rejected repeated attempts
[NKREA|051D]by the IAEA to discuss
[NKREA|051E]the  uranium enrichment
[NKREA|051F]issue.


[NKREA|0520]The IAEA Board
[NKREA|0521]of Governors passed
[NKREA|0522]a resolution on November 29,
[NKREA|0523]2002, calling on North Korea
[NKREA|0524]to clarify reports
[NKREA|0525]of a uranium enrichment program
[NKREA|0526]and come into 
[NKREA|0527]compliance with its safeguards agreement.


[NKREA|0528]The resolution said that “any
[NKREA|0529]other covert nuclear 
[NKREA|052A]activities would constitute
[NKREA|052B]a violation of
[NKREA|052C]the DPRK’s international commitments,

[NKREA|052E]safeguards agreement with

[NKREA|0531]On November 14, 2002, KEDO
[NKREA|0532]board members also
[NKREA|0533]determined that the hidden program
[NKREA|0534]was a  violation
[NKREA|0535]of these agreements
[NKREA|0536]and decided to halt fuel
[NKREA|0537]oil shipments to North Korea
[NKREA|0538]beginning in  December.


[NKREA|0539]KEDO said that, “Future shipments
[NKREA|053A]will depend on North Korea’s
[NKREA|053B]concrete and  credible
[NKREA|053C]actions to dismantle completely its
[NKREA|053D]highly-enriched uranium program.” North Korea
[NKREA|053E]then  told
[NKREA|053F]the IAEA in mid-December 2002
[NKREA|0540]that, since the
[NKREA|0541]United States had
[NKREA|0542]failed to live up to
[NKREA|0543]its  obligations
[NKREA|0544]by suspending heavy fuel oil
[NKREA|0545]deliveries, it was
[NKREA|0546]expelling inspectors from its Yongbyon
[NKREA|0547]nuclear site and
[NKREA|0548]removing all monitoring cameras
[NKREA|0549]and breaking seals.


[NKREA|054A]North Korea announced its 
[NKREA|054B]withdrawal from the NPT effective
[NKREA|054C]January 11, 2003,
[NKREA|054D]and resumed plutonium production
[NKREA|054E]after an  apparent
[NKREA|054F]eight-year freeze.31 With this confrontation,
[NKREA|0550]the already uneasy U.S.-DPRK relationship
[NKREA|0551]shifted to a
[NKREA|0552]more hostile one.


[NKREA|0553]The Six-Party  Process
[NKREA|0554]and Agreements  
[NKREA|0555]In an effort to resolve

[NKREA|0558]rather than the bilateral negotiations
[NKREA|0559]with the United States that
[NKREA|055A]Pyongyang preferred.


[NKREA|055B]After  months

[NKREA|055D]the People’s Republic

[NKREA|0561]of the Six-Party Talks,
[NKREA|0562]involving China, Japan, North Korea,
[NKREA|0563]Russia, South Korea,
[NKREA|0564]and the 
[NKREA|0565]United States.


[NKREA|0566]In 2005, after
[NKREA|0567]the fourth round
[NKREA|0568]of talks, the six parties
[NKREA|0569]issued a joint statement 
[NKREA|056A]outlining principles for
[NKREA|056B]achieving verifiable denuclearization
[NKREA|056C]of the Korean Peninsula,
[NKREA|056D]which 
[NKREA|056E]formed the basis
[NKREA|056F]for future agreements.32 Specific steps
[NKREA|0570]to address the nuclear program
[NKREA|0571]were  known
[NKREA|0572]as “CVID,” standing
[NKREA|0573]for complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement.


[NKREA|0574]In the statement, 
[NKREA|0575]the DPRK agreed to abandon
[NKREA|0576]“all nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0577]and existing nuclear programs.”
[NKREA|0578]The statement 
[NKREA|0579]outlined compromises on
[NKREA|057A]the provision of LWRs
[NKREA|057B]and other energy assistance to
[NKREA|057C]the DPRK, U.S. 
[NKREA|057D]security guarantees, normalization
[NKREA|057E]of diplomatic relations between
[NKREA|057F]the DPRK and
[NKREA|0580]the United  States
[NKREA|0581]and Japan, and
[NKREA|0582]the negotiation of
[NKREA|0583]a peace treaty.


[NKREA|0584]Follow-up negotiations stalled almost immediately,
[NKREA|0585]particularly after the U.S. Department
[NKREA|0586]of the  Treasury’s
[NKREA|0587]September 2005 designation
[NKREA|0588]of Banco Delta Asia (BDA),
[NKREA|0589]a bank based in
[NKREA|058A]the PRC  territory
[NKREA|058B]of Macao, as
[NKREA|058C]a financial institution
[NKREA|058D]of primary money
[NKREA|058E]laundering concern, due to 
[NKREA|058F]suspected counterfeiting.33 The action was
[NKREA|0590]taken the same week
[NKREA|0591]the Joint Statement was released,
[NKREA|0592]leading some observers to conclude
[NKREA|0593]that anti-negotiation policymakers within
[NKREA|0594]the Administration  were
[NKREA|0595]trying to sabotage
[NKREA|0596]the agreement.34 The designation led
[NKREA|0597]the Macao Monetary Authorities to
[NKREA|0598]take over BDA
[NKREA|0599]and freeze dozens
[NKREA|059A]of North Korean accounts
[NKREA|059B]with about $25 million in
[NKREA|059C]deposits.


[NKREA|059D]It 
[NKREA|059E]also prompted financial institutions in
[NKREA|059F]other countries to pull out
[NKREA|05A0]of BDA and close many
[NKREA|05A1]of the  accounts
[NKREA|05A2]they held for North Korean
[NKREA|05A3]entities, even those
[NKREA|05A4]engaged in legitimate business.


[NKREA|05A5]The  BDA action
[NKREA|05A6]had a chilling effect on
[NKREA|05A7]the Six-Party Talks,
[NKREA|05A8]with North Korea
[NKREA|05A9]demanding a  resolution
[NKREA|05AA]before it would
[NKREA|05AB]make significant concessions on
[NKREA|05AC]the nuclear issue.35

[NKREA|0627]On October 9, 2006, North
[NKREA|0628]Korea tested a nuclear device
[NKREA|0629]for the first time.


[NKREA|062A]The test led
[NKREA|062B]the other  members
[NKREA|062C]of the talks to toughen
[NKREA|062D]their stance toward North Korea
[NKREA|062E]and seek stronger multilateral 
[NKREA|062F]sanctions.


[NKREA|0630]Within a week,
[NKREA|0631]the United Nations Security Council
[NKREA|0632](UNSC) passed its
[NKREA|0633]first DPRK  sanctions
[NKREA|0634]resolution, 1718, which
[NKREA|0635]called on North Korea to
[NKREA|0636]abandon its nuclear weapons in
[NKREA|0637]a  “complete, verifiable,
[NKREA|0638]and irreversible manner”
[NKREA|0639]and required its member states
[NKREA|063A]to impose  international
[NKREA|063B]sanctions.36  
[NKREA|063C]Following months of diplomacy,
[NKREA|063D]the Six-Party Talks
[NKREA|063E]resumed and, in February 2007,
[NKREA|063F]reached an  agreement
[NKREA|0640]to begin the initial 60-day
[NKREA|0641]phase to implement
[NKREA|0642]the 2005 Joint Statement.37 North
[NKREA|0643]Korea 
[NKREA|0644]agreed to disable all nuclear
[NKREA|0645]facilities and provide
[NKREA|0646]a “complete and correct” declaration
[NKREA|0647]of all its 
[NKREA|0648]nuclear programs, in exchange
[NKREA|0649]for the delivery
[NKREA|064A]of heavy fuel oil
[NKREA|064B]and removal of
[NKREA|064C]the United States’ 
[NKREA|064D]Trading with the Enemy Act
[NKREA|064E]and State Sponsors
[NKREA|064F]of Terrorism designations.38 Separately,
[NKREA|0650]the 
[NKREA|0651]United States assured North Korea
[NKREA|0652]that it would return frozen
[NKREA|0653]North Korean funds to North
[NKREA|0654]Korea, which it did
[NKREA|0655]later that year.39 China, Japan,
[NKREA|0656]Russia, South Korea,
[NKREA|0657]and the United States 
[NKREA|0658]agreed to divide their obligation
[NKREA|0659]to provide energy assistance to
[NKREA|065A]North Korea evenly among 
[NKREA|065B]them.40 IAEA inspectors
[NKREA|065C]returned to North Korea in
[NKREA|065D]July 2007 to monitor
[NKREA|065E]and verify the shut- 
[NKREA|065F]down, install seals,
[NKREA|0660]and monitor facilities at Yongbyon,
[NKREA|0661]and had a continuous presence
[NKREA|0662]there until  mid-April
[NKREA|0663]2009.41  
[NKREA|0664]39 In June 2007,
[NKREA|0665]the United States
[NKREA|0666]arranged for the $25 million
[NKREA|0667]in frozen North Korea assets
[NKREA|0668]in BDA accounts to be
[NKREA|0669]transferred through the New York
[NKREA|066A]Federal Reserve Bank to
[NKREA|066B]a bank in Russia,
[NKREA|066C]which transferred the funds on
[NKREA|066D]to North  Korea.


[NKREA|066E]North Korea confirmed receipt
[NKREA|066F]of the money on June
[NKREA|0670]25, 2007.


[NKREA|0671]Pyongyang promised that it
[NKREA|0672]would punish the 
[NKREA|0673]counterfeiters and destroy their equipment.


[NKREA|0674]40 Japan did
[NKREA|0675]not provide its share
[NKREA|0676]of energy assistance to Pyongyang
[NKREA|0677]because North Korea
[NKREA|0678]had not resolved
[NKREA|0679]the issue of 
[NKREA|067A]Japanese citizens abducted
[NKREA|067B]by North Korea

[NKREA|069D]during a December 2010 Pyongyang

[NKREA|069F]would allow IAEA 
[NKREA|06A0]inspectors into the country to
[NKREA|06A1]verify the peaceful nature
[NKREA|06A2]of the uranium enrichment plant
[NKREA|06A3]at Yongbyon.


[NKREA|06A4]Chris Buckley,  “North
[NKREA|06A5]Korea to allow in IAEA
[NKREA|06A6]inspectors—Richardson,” Reuters, December 21, 2010.


[NKREA|06A7]During this nearly two-year period,
[NKREA|06A8]agreement on verification measures was
[NKREA|06A9]elusive—North  Korea
[NKREA|06AA]refused to allow IAEA inspectors
[NKREA|06AB]access to its facilities,
[NKREA|06AC]which was followed
[NKREA|06AD]by a slowing 
[NKREA|06AE]of benefits from
[NKREA|06AF]the other countries.


[NKREA|06B0]This led to
[NKREA|06B1]growing tensions.42 The six parties
[NKREA|06B2]held their last 
[NKREA|06B3]round of talks,
[NKREA|06B4]which ended in
[NKREA|06B5]a stalemate over verification procedures,
[NKREA|06B6]in December 2008.


[NKREA|06B7]The Six-Party Talks Collapse 
[NKREA|06B8]In 2009, North Korea
[NKREA|06B9]shifted its policy away from
[NKREA|06BA]the Six-Party Talks
[NKREA|06BB]and toward a
[NKREA|06BC]more 
[NKREA|06BD]concerted effort to develop its
[NKREA|06BE]nuclear weapons capability.


[NKREA|06BF]This shift coincided
[NKREA|06C0]with a decline in 
[NKREA|06C1]Kim Jong-il’s health,
[NKREA|06C2]which reportedly began in summer
[NKREA|06C3]2008.


[NKREA|06C4]At the same time, President
[NKREA|06C5]Barack Obama’s inaugural address on
[NKREA|06C6]January 21, 2009, sought to
[NKREA|06C7]distinguish his Administration 
[NKREA|06C8]from his predecessor’s “axis
[NKREA|06C9]of evil” approach,
[NKREA|06CA]saying that the
[NKREA|06CB]United States would “extend
[NKREA|06CC]a  hand”
[NKREA|06CD]if dictatorships of
[NKREA|06CE]the world were
[NKREA|06CF]willing to “unclench” their fists.43
[NKREA|06D0]The new Administration
[NKREA|06D1]changed gears when North Korea
[NKREA|06D2]launched a long-range rocket in
[NKREA|06D3]April  2009.


[NKREA|06D4]The following week,
[NKREA|06D5]the UNSC issued
[NKREA|06D6]a statement condemning
[NKREA|06D7]the launch as
[NKREA|06D8]a violation of 
[NKREA|06D9]the UNSC’s 2006 DPRK resolution
[NKREA|06DA]and calling for additional punitive
[NKREA|06DB]measures.


[NKREA|06DC]In response,  North
[NKREA|06DD]Korea announced its withdrawal from
[NKREA|06DE]the Six-Party Talks,
[NKREA|06DF]expelled international monitors, 
[NKREA|06E0]and restarted its
[NKREA|06E1]reprocessing facility.


[NKREA|06E2]The following month, it
[NKREA|06E3]conducted a second nuclear test.


[NKREA|06E4]North Korea subsequently
[NKREA|06E5]restored its disabled plutonium production
[NKREA|06E6]facilities and reactor,
[NKREA|06E7]and  built
[NKREA|06E8]a uranium enrichment plant at
[NKREA|06E9]Yongbyon.


[NKREA|06EA]In November 2009, North Korea
[NKREA|06EB]invited a group 
[NKREA|06EC]of former high-level U.S. officials
[NKREA|06ED]to tour a pilot uranium
[NKREA|06EE]enrichment plant at Yongbyon in
[NKREA|06EF]a  likely attempt
[NKREA|06F0]to demonstrate its
[NKREA|06F1]growing capabilities.44  
[NKREA|06F2]Two North Korean attacks on
[NKREA|06F3]South Korea in 2010
[NKREA|06F4]made the atmosphere
[NKREA|06F5]for talks even
[NKREA|06F6]more  difficult.


[NKREA|06F7]In March, an explosion sank
[NKREA|06F8]a South Korean navy corvette,
[NKREA|06F9]the Cheonan, killing 46 
[NKREA|06FA]sailors.


[NKREA|06FB]A multinational investigation team led
[NKREA|06FC]by South Korea
[NKREA|06FD]determined that the ship was
[NKREA|06FE]sunk 
[NKREA|06FF]by a North Korean submarine.


[NKREA|0700]In November 2010, North Korea
[NKREA|0701]launched an artillery attack 
[NKREA|0702]against South Korea’s Yeonpyeong Island,
[NKREA|0703]killing two South Korean marines
[NKREA|0704]and two civilians, 
[NKREA|0705]and wounding dozens.


[NKREA|0706]Thereafter, the Obama Administration
[NKREA|0707]adopted what has been
[NKREA|0708]dubbed a  strategy
[NKREA|0709]of “strategic patience,”
[NKREA|070A]with a focus on
[NKREA|070B]coordinating its efforts
[NKREA|070C]with allies and
[NKREA|070D]insisting  that North
[NKREA|070E]Korea first change its aggressive
[NKREA|070F]behavior toward the South
[NKREA|0710]before international talks 
[NKREA|0711]could commence.


[NKREA|0712]U.S. Food Aid Policy
[NKREA|0713]and Nuclear Talks 
[NKREA|0714]From 1996 to 2009,
[NKREA|0715]the United States was one
[NKREA|0716]of the largest providers
[NKREA|0717]of food assistance to North
[NKREA|0718]Korea.


[NKREA|0719]North  Korea suffers
[NKREA|071A]from chronic food shortages
[NKREA|071B]and experienced a massive famine
[NKREA|071C]in the 1990s that
[NKREA|071D]killed an estimated 
[NKREA|071E]5%-10% of North Korea’s population.


[NKREA|071F]Under the George W. Bush
[NKREA|0720]Administration, the aid
[NKREA|0721]continued but at lower 
[NKREA|0722]levels and less consistently
[NKREA|0723]than under the Clinton Administration.


[NKREA|0724]Under the Clinton
[NKREA|0725]and Bush Administrations, 
[NKREA|0726]U.S. officially stated policy was
[NKREA|0727]to delink food
[NKREA|0728]and humanitarian aid from strategic
[NKREA|0729]interests.


[NKREA|072A]Many observers  contended,
[NKREA|072B]however, that from 1996 to
[NKREA|072C]2001, the Clinton Administration used
[NKREA|072D]food aid to secure North
[NKREA|072E]Korea’s  participation
[NKREA|072F]and increased cooperation in
[NKREA|0730]a variety of
[NKREA|0731]security-related negotiations.45 In contrast,
[NKREA|0732]the George W. 
[NKREA|0733]Bush Administration arguably
[NKREA|0734]weakened the linkage between security
[NKREA|0735]issues and food aid
[NKREA|0736]by making improved 
[NKREA|0737]monitoring and access
[NKREA|0738]of food aid one
[NKREA|0739]of three explicit conditions
[NKREA|073A]for providing food aid to
[NKREA|073B]North Korea.


[NKREA|073C](The  other two
[NKREA|073D]were the need in North
[NKREA|073E]Korea and competing needs
[NKREA|073F]for U.S. food assistance.)46
[NKREA|0740]The Obama  Administration’s
[NKREA|0741]February 2012 understanding
[NKREA|0742]with North Korea on
[NKREA|0743]the resumption of food assistance
[NKREA|0744]appeared  to reverse
[NKREA|0745]this shift by directly
[NKREA|0746]linking the aid to concessions
[NKREA|0747]that North Korea was
[NKREA|0748]expected to make on
[NKREA|0749]the  nuclear issue.


[NKREA|074A]The United States
[NKREA|074B]has not provided food aid
[NKREA|074C]to North Korea
[NKREA|074D]since early 2009.

[NKREA|0767]The 2012 Leap Day Deal
[NKREA|0768]Throughout 2011, the Obama Administration
[NKREA|0769]held secret bilateral discussions
[NKREA|076A]with North Korea in 
[NKREA|076B]an attempt to return to
[NKREA|076C]denuclearization negotiations, while
[NKREA|076D]also publicly pursuing steps to
[NKREA|076E]increase sanctions on Pyongyang.


[NKREA|076F]After Kim Jong-il died in
[NKREA|0770]December 2011, U.S. officials were
[NKREA|0771]uncertain whether Kim’s son
[NKREA|0772]and successor, Kim Jong Un,
[NKREA|0773]would agree to terms that
[NKREA|0774]had been 
[NKREA|0775]discussed under his father.


[NKREA|0776]An apparent breakthrough in talks
[NKREA|0777]came on February 29, 2012,
[NKREA|0778]when 
[NKREA|0779]the United States
[NKREA|077A]and North Korea separately
[NKREA|077B]announced agreement—referred to
[NKREA|077C]as the “Leap 
[NKREA|077D]Day Deal”—on a number
[NKREA|077E]of steps that
[NKREA|077F]the Obama Administration
[NKREA|0780]hoped would pave
[NKREA|0781]the way for
[NKREA|0782]a  return to
[NKREA|0783]denuclearization talks under
[NKREA|0784]the Six-Party Talks process.


[NKREA|0785]North Korea committed to
[NKREA|0786]a  long-range missile
[NKREA|0787]testing moratorium;


[NKREA|0788]a nuclear testing moratorium;


[NKREA|0789]a moratorium on nuclear 
[NKREA|078A]activities, including uranium enrichment at
[NKREA|078B]Yongbyon;


[NKREA|078C]and a return
[NKREA|078D]of IAEA inspectors to
[NKREA|078E]the  Yongbyon nuclear
[NKREA|078F]facilities.


[NKREA|0790]Separately, the United States
[NKREA|0791]announced that the two countries
[NKREA|0792]would  hold further
[NKREA|0793]talks to finalize details
[NKREA|0794]of a “targeted U.S. program
[NKREA|0795]consisting of an initial 240,000
[NKREA|0796]metric tons of nutritional assistance
[NKREA|0797]with the prospect
[NKREA|0798]of additional assistance
[NKREA|0799]based on continued 
[NKREA|079A]need.” The U.S. statement
[NKREA|079B]also emphasized a range
[NKREA|079C]of issues, including
[NKREA|079D]the United States’ 
[NKREA|079E]continued commitment to
[NKREA|079F]the 1953 armistice agreement that
[NKREA|07A0]halted fighting during
[NKREA|07A1]the Korean  War,
[NKREA|07A2]as well as
[NKREA|07A3]a desire to increase people-to-people
[NKREA|07A4]contacts with the DPRK.47 
[NKREA|07A5]Movement toward a restart
[NKREA|07A6]of U.S.-North Korean diplomacy was
[NKREA|07A7]short-lived, however.


[NKREA|07A8]In March  2012,
[NKREA|07A9]North Korea announced it
[NKREA|07AA]would launch an “earth observation
[NKREA|07AB]satellite.” The United States 
[NKREA|07AC]responded by suspending its portion
[NKREA|07AD]of the “Leap Day” arrangement,
[NKREA|07AE]saying that the launch 
[NKREA|07AF]would go against
[NKREA|07B0]the terms of
[NKREA|07B1]the agreement and violate UNSC
[NKREA|07B2]sanctions against the DPRK’s use
[NKREA|07B3]of ballistic missile technology.48
[NKREA|07B4]The launch—which failed
[NKREA|07B5]when the rocket
[NKREA|07B6]exploded shortly after 
[NKREA|07B7]takeoff—took place the
[NKREA|07B8]following month;


[NKREA|07B9]it was condemned
[NKREA|07BA]by the UNSC
[NKREA|07BB]as a “serious 
[NKREA|07BC]violation” of resolutions against
[NKREA|07BD]the use of ballistic missile
[NKREA|07BE]technology.49 In May 2012, North
[NKREA|07BF]Korea changed its constitution to
[NKREA|07C0]say that the country was
[NKREA|07C1]a “nuclear-armed state.”

[NKREA|07CC]The possibility of military conflict,

[NKREA|07CE]involving the U.S.

[NKREA|07D0]sufficiently high during 2017 that

[NKREA|07D2]reportedly 
[NKREA|07D3]visited the War Memorial Chapel

[NKREA|07E3]2018-2019 Top-Down U.S.-DPRK Talks 
[NKREA|07E4]Background: 2016-2017 Tensions 
[NKREA|07E5]In 2016 and 2017, North
[NKREA|07E6]Korea conducted scores
[NKREA|07E7]of missile tests
[NKREA|07E8]and three nuclear weapons tests,
[NKREA|07E9]demonstrating major strides in its
[NKREA|07EA]ability to strike
[NKREA|07EB]the continental United States
[NKREA|07EC]with a nuclear- 
[NKREA|07ED]armed ballistic missile.


[NKREA|07EE]The Obama Administration
[NKREA|07EF]responded by expanding international
[NKREA|07F0]and  unilateral sanctions
[NKREA|07F1]against North Korea,
[NKREA|07F2]including two new UNSC resolutions
[NKREA|07F3]that began to 
[NKREA|07F4]expand international sanctions to cover
[NKREA|07F5]entire sectors of
[NKREA|07F6]the North Korean economy, such
[NKREA|07F7]as  North Korea’s
[NKREA|07F8]coal exports.


[NKREA|07F9]Earlier UNSC resolutions primarily were
[NKREA|07FA]tied to activities directly 
[NKREA|07FB]related to North Korea’s weapons
[NKREA|07FC]of mass destruction (WMD) activities.


[NKREA|07FD]In its first year in
[NKREA|07FE]office, the Trump Administration
[NKREA|07FF]adopted a “maximum pressure” North
[NKREA|0800]Korea  policy that
[NKREA|0801]sought to coerce Pyongyang into
[NKREA|0802]changing its behavior through economic
[NKREA|0803]and  diplomatic measures.


[NKREA|0804]Many of the elements
[NKREA|0805]of the officially
[NKREA|0806]stated policy were similar to
[NKREA|0807]those 
[NKREA|0808]employed by the Obama Administration:
[NKREA|0809]ratcheting up economic pressure against
[NKREA|080A]North Korea, 
[NKREA|080B]attempting to persuade China
[NKREA|080C]and others to apply
[NKREA|080D]more pressure against Pyongyang,
[NKREA|080E]and 
[NKREA|080F]expanding the capabilities
[NKREA|0810]of the U.S.-South Korea
[NKREA|0811]and U.S.-Japan alliances to counter
[NKREA|0812]new North  Korean
[NKREA|0813]threats.


[NKREA|0814]The Administration led
[NKREA|0815]the UNSC to pass four
[NKREA|0816]new sanctions resolutions that 
[NKREA|0817]significantly expanded the requirements
[NKREA|0818]for U.N.


[NKREA|0819]member states to curtail
[NKREA|081A]or halt their military, 
[NKREA|081B]diplomatic, and economic interaction
[NKREA|081C]with the DPRK.


[NKREA|081D]Cumulatively, the six resolutions
[NKREA|081E]adopted  in 2016
[NKREA|081F]and 2017 banned
[NKREA|0820]over 75% of North Korea’s
[NKREA|0821]exports, as well
[NKREA|0822]as many of its imports
[NKREA|0823]for  other
[NKREA|0824]than basic livelihood needs.


[NKREA|0825]Both the Obama
[NKREA|0826]and Trump Administrations
[NKREA|0827]pushed countries  around
[NKREA|0828]the globe to significantly reduce
[NKREA|0829]or eliminate their ties to
[NKREA|082A]North Korea.


[NKREA|082B]In a departure from previous
[NKREA|082C]administrations, the Trump Administration
[NKREA|082D]emphasized the option
[NKREA|082E]of 
[NKREA|082F]launching a preventive military strike
[NKREA|0830]against North Korea
[NKREA|0831]and began making preparations
[NKREA|0832]for a  military
[NKREA|0833]conflict, significantly increasing tensions on
[NKREA|0834]the Korean Peninsula.50 President Trump
[NKREA|0835]and North Korean leader Kim
[NKREA|0836]Jong Un exchanged bellicose public
[NKREA|0837]insults, with Trump in August
[NKREA|0838]2017 saying “North Korea best
[NKREA|0839]not make any
[NKREA|083A]more threats to
[NKREA|083B]the United States.


[NKREA|083C]They will be met 
[NKREA|083D]with fire and fury
[NKREA|083E]like the world
[NKREA|083F]has never seen.”51 
[NKREA|0840]In addition to its nuclear
[NKREA|0841]and missile tests in
[NKREA|0842]the 2016-2017 period, North Korea
[NKREA|0843]escalated tension  in
[NKREA|0844]other ways.


[NKREA|0845]In February 2017, North Korean
[NKREA|0846]agents were implicated in
[NKREA|0847]the use of
[NKREA|0848]the toxic  chemical
[NKREA|0849]nerve agent VX to assassinate
[NKREA|084A]Kim Jong Un’s half-brother in
[NKREA|084B]the Kuala Lumpur 
[NKREA|084C]International Airport.52 In
[NKREA|084D]the months after South Korea’s
[NKREA|084E]election of longtime engagement 
[NKREA|084F]proponent Moon Jae-in to
[NKREA|0850]the Presidency in May 2017,
[NKREA|0851]North Korea essentially
[NKREA|0852]ignored Moon’s  proposals
[NKREA|0853]for dialogue and engagement such
[NKREA|0854]as restoring a military hotline,
[NKREA|0855]providing small-scale  humanitarian
[NKREA|0856]assistance, and resuming programs to
[NKREA|0857]temporarily reunite families
[NKREA|0858]separated since 
[NKREA|0859]the Korean War.


[NKREA|085A]Meanwhile, in July that same
[NKREA|085B]year, U.S. and global attention
[NKREA|085C]was focused on
[NKREA|085D]the  Kim regime’s
[NKREA|085E]human rights abuses
[NKREA|085F]when North Korea
[NKREA|0860]allowed the Trump Administration to
[NKREA|0861]repatriate Otto Warmbier,
[NKREA|0862]a U.S. college student
[NKREA|0863]who had lapsed into
[NKREA|0864]a coma during
[NKREA|0865]a year-and-a- half
[NKREA|0866]of imprisonment.


[NKREA|0867]Warmbier, whom North Korean authorities
[NKREA|0868]had detained after he reportedly
[NKREA|0869]stole a poster from
[NKREA|086A]a restricted area
[NKREA|086B]of a tourist hotel, died

[NKREA|0898]Rapprochement in 2018
[NKREA|0899]and 201953  
[NKREA|089A]On January 1, 2018,
[NKREA|089B]following months of outreach
[NKREA|089C]by South Korean officials
[NKREA|089D]hoping to lower 
[NKREA|089E]tensions, Kim Jong Un used
[NKREA|089F]his annual New Year’s speech
[NKREA|08A0]to accept an invitation from
[NKREA|08A1]ROK  President Moon
[NKREA|08A2]Jae-in to participate in
[NKREA|08A3]the February 2018 Winter Olympics
[NKREA|08A4]in PyeongChang,  South
[NKREA|08A5]Korea.


[NKREA|08A6]The United States
[NKREA|08A7]and South Korea
[NKREA|08A8]agreed to delay annual joint
[NKREA|08A9]military drills— originally
[NKREA|08AA]scheduled to begin in February—until
[NKREA|08AB]after the Olympics
[NKREA|08AC]and appeared to work 
[NKREA|08AD]together to ensure that North
[NKREA|08AE]Korea’s participation did
[NKREA|08AF]not violate UNSC, U.S.,
[NKREA|08B0]or ROK  sanctions.


[NKREA|08B1]Pyongyang sent to
[NKREA|08B2]the Olympics a high-level delegation,
[NKREA|08B3]including Kim Jong Un’s 
[NKREA|08B4]sister and high-ranking Communist Party
[NKREA|08B5]official, Kim Yo Jong,
[NKREA|08B6]who conveyed a message that
[NKREA|08B7]her brother welcomed
[NKREA|08B8]the restoration of positive inter-Korean
[NKREA|08B9]relations.


[NKREA|08BA]Shortly afterwards, South Korean National
[NKREA|08BB]Security Advisor Chung Eui-young led
[NKREA|08BC]a delegation to 
[NKREA|08BD]Pyongyang, where it met
[NKREA|08BE]with Kim Jong Un.
[NKREA|08BF]The South Korean delegates
[NKREA|08C0]reported that the North 
[NKREA|08C1]Korean leader said that
[NKREA|08C2]the DPRK “would
[NKREA|08C3]have no reason to possess
[NKREA|08C4]nuclear [weapons] if military 
[NKREA|08C5]threats against North Korea were
[NKREA|08C6]dissolved and North Korea’s regime
[NKREA|08C7]security was guaranteed.” 
[NKREA|08C8]They said that Kim
[NKREA|08C9]also indicated a willingness to
[NKREA|08CA]have “open-ended dialogue”
[NKREA|08CB]with the United 
[NKREA|08CC]States to discuss denuclearization
[NKREA|08CD]of the Korean Peninsula
[NKREA|08CE]and the normalization
[NKREA|08CF]of U.S.-DPRK  relations.


[NKREA|08D0]Chung’s delegation also
[NKREA|08D1]reported that Pyongyang
[NKREA|08D2]would freeze nuclear
[NKREA|08D3]and missile tests 
[NKREA|08D4]if dialogue resumed,
[NKREA|08D5]and that Kim “understands” that
[NKREA|08D6]routine U.S.-ROK joint military exercises
[NKREA|08D7]would continue.54 North Korea typically
[NKREA|08D8]treats these exercises
[NKREA|08D9]as threats and
[NKREA|08DA]often responds with 
[NKREA|08DB]provocative activities.


[NKREA|08DC]The two Koreas
[NKREA|08DD]agreed to hold
[NKREA|08DE]a leaders’ summit in April
[NKREA|08DF]2018 in  Panmunjom,
[NKREA|08E0]located in the joint security
[NKREA|08E1]area of the
[NKREA|08E2]Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates
[NKREA|08E3]the  two countries.


[NKREA|08E4]Three days later, President Trump
[NKREA|08E5]unexpectedly accepted an invitation,
[NKREA|08E6]delivered 
[NKREA|08E7]by Chung, to meet
[NKREA|08E8]with Kim.55  
[NKREA|08E9]Why did Kim Embark on
[NKREA|08EA]a  Charm Offensive
[NKREA|08EB]in  2018 
[NKREA|08EC]?  
[NKREA|08ED]Opinions vary on
[NKREA|08EE]why Kim adjusted course to
[NKREA|08EF]launch a “charm offensive” in
[NKREA|08F0]early 2018, after
[NKREA|08F1]carrying out a series 
[NKREA|08F2]of provocations in previous years.


[NKREA|08F3]Several possible factors drove Kim
[NKREA|08F4]to pursue diplomacy,
[NKREA|08F5]including  
[NKREA|08F6](1) Kim’s confidence that he
[NKREA|08F7]had secured a
[NKREA|08F8]limited nuclear deterrent against
[NKREA|08F9]the United States,
[NKREA|08FA]providing him with 
[NKREA|08FB]additional leverage;


[NKREA|08FC](2) fears of
[NKREA|08FD]a U.S. military strike
[NKREA|08FE]and the possibility
[NKREA|08FF]of military conflict;


[NKREA|0900](3) the increasingly
[NKREA|0901]punishing sanctions that
[NKREA|0902]limited the North’s ability to
[NKREA|0903]expand its economy;


[NKREA|0904]and/or  
[NKREA|0905](4) Moon Jae-in’s persistent outreach
[NKREA|0906]to North Korea,
[NKREA|0907]including during the 2018 Winter
[NKREA|0908]Olympics.


[NKREA|0909]A flurry of diplomatic activity
[NKREA|090A]followed, most notably
[NKREA|090B]the first inter-Korean summit in
[NKREA|090C]over a  decade,
[NKREA|090D]from which Moon
[NKREA|090E]and Kim issued
[NKREA|090F]the “Panmunjom Declaration,” in
[NKREA|0910]which the two 
[NKREA|0911]leaders pledged to realize “through
[NKREA|0912]complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean
[NKREA|0913]Peninsula,”  to issue
[NKREA|0914]a declaration ending
[NKREA|0915]the Korean War
[NKREA|0916]by the end
[NKREA|0917]of 2018, and to open
[NKREA|0918]a range of inter- 
[NKREA|0919]Korean dialogues and cooperation projects.56

[NKREA|092C]Absent verification, it remains difficult
[NKREA|092D]to determine the extent
[NKREA|092E]of and irreversibility
[NKREA|092F]of North Korea’s subsequent 
[NKREA|0930]steps to close

[NKREA|0932]According to U.S.

[NKREA|0959]Other events in April

[NKREA|095E]U.S. summits with South Korea

[NKREA|0961]then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
[NKREA|0962]and Kim Jong Un.57 Moon
[NKREA|0963]and Kim  held
[NKREA|0964]a second summit in Panmunjom
[NKREA|0965]on short notice, to repair
[NKREA|0966]a short-lived breakdown in U.S.-
[NKREA|0967]DPRK coordination over
[NKREA|0968]the Trump-Kim summit,
[NKREA|0969]which was scheduled
[NKREA|096A]for June.


[NKREA|096B]In addition, 
[NKREA|096C]during a North Korean Workers’
[NKREA|096D]Party meeting, Kim Jong Un
[NKREA|096E]declared “victory” in
[NKREA|096F]developing  nuclear weapons,
[NKREA|0970]intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs),
[NKREA|0971]and the ability to mount
[NKREA|0972]nuclear  warheads on
[NKREA|0973]ballistic missiles.


[NKREA|0974]Accordingly, Kim continued, “…
[NKREA|0975]no nuclear test
[NKREA|0976]and intermediate- range
[NKREA|0977]and inter-continental ballistic rocket test-fire
[NKREA|0978]are necessary for
[NKREA|0979]the DPRK now….”
[NKREA|097A]and 
[NKREA|097B]announced the country
[NKREA|097C]would dismantle its Pyunggye-ri nuclear
[NKREA|097D]testing site.


[NKREA|097E]Because North Korea 
[NKREA|097F]had successfully advanced its nuclear
[NKREA|0980]force, Kim said, its new
[NKREA|0981]“strategic line” will “concentrate 
[NKREA|0982]all efforts of
[NKREA|0983]the whole party
[NKREA|0984]and country on
[NKREA|0985]the socialist economic construction.”58 
[NKREA|0986]The June 2018 Singapore Summit
[NKREA|0987]The June 12, 2018 summit
[NKREA|0988]between Trump and Kim was
[NKREA|0989]the first-ever meeting between
[NKREA|098A]a sitting  U.S.
[NKREA|098B]President and a leader
[NKREA|098C]of North Korea.


[NKREA|098D]At their one-day meeting, Trump
[NKREA|098E]and Kim issued
[NKREA|098F]a  brief joint
[NKREA|0990]statement in which Trump
[NKREA|0991]“committed to provide security guarantees
[NKREA|0992]to the DPRK,” 
[NKREA|0993]and Kim “reaffirmed his firm
[NKREA|0994]and unwavering commitment to complete
[NKREA|0995]denuclearization of the 
[NKREA|0996]Korean Peninsula.”59 The Singapore document
[NKREA|0997]was shorter on details
[NKREA|0998]than previous nuclear 
[NKREA|0999]agreements with North Korea
[NKREA|099A]and served as
[NKREA|099B]a statement of principles in
[NKREA|099C]four areas, listed in order
[NKREA|099D]of appearance:  
[NKREA|099E]• Normalization: The two sides
[NKREA|099F]“commit to establish” new bilateral
[NKREA|09A0]relations.


[NKREA|09A1]• Peace: The two sides
[NKREA|09A2]agreed to work to build
[NKREA|09A3]“a lasting and stable peace
[NKREA|09A4]regime.”  • Denuclearization:
[NKREA|09A5]North Korea “commits to work
[NKREA|09A6]toward complete  denuclearization
[NKREA|09A7]of the Korean Peninsula,”
[NKREA|09A8]as was also
[NKREA|09A9]promised in an April 2018
[NKREA|09AA]summit between Kim
[NKREA|09AB]and Moon.


[NKREA|09AC]• POW/MIA remains:
[NKREA|09AD]The two sides
[NKREA|09AE]agreed to cooperate to recover
[NKREA|09AF]the remains 
[NKREA|09B0]of thousands of U.S. troops
[NKREA|09B1]unaccounted for during
[NKREA|09B2]the Korean War.60 
[NKREA|09B3]60 According to
[NKREA|09B4]the U.S. Defense POW/MIA
[NKREA|09B5]Accounting Agency (DPAA), nearly 7,700
[NKREA|09B6]U.S. personnel who fought 
[NKREA|09B7]during the Korean War are
[NKREA|09B8]“unaccounted-for,” approximately 5,300
[NKREA|09B9]of whom are
[NKREA|09BA]believed to have been “lost
[NKREA|09BB]in Korea.”

[NKREA|09BD]Conference by President Trump,” June
[NKREA|09BE]12, 2018.


[NKREA|09BF]Trump added that
[NKREA|09C0]the move, which was 
[NKREA|09C1]not accompanied by any apparent
[NKREA|09C2]commensurate move by Pyongyang
[NKREA|09C3]and reportedly surprised South Korea
[NKREA|09C4]and U.S.  military
[NKREA|09C5]commanders, would save “a tremendous
[NKREA|09C6]amount of money.”
[NKREA|09C7]The week after
[NKREA|09C8]the summit, the Defense 
[NKREA|09C9]Department announced that
[NKREA|09CA]the annual U.S.-South Korea “Ulchi
[NKREA|09CB]Freedom Guardian” exercises
[NKREA|09CC]scheduled for August 
[NKREA|09CD]would be cancelled.

[NKREA|09D3]63 For example, Trump Administration
[NKREA|09D4]officials had asserted that North
[NKREA|09D5]Korean “denuclearization” would include
[NKREA|09D6]the 
[NKREA|09D7]dismantling of Pyongyang’s chemical

[NKREA|09E4]agreed with this inclusion.

[NKREA|09E6]and Kim May Define ‘Korea
[NKREA|09E7]Denuclearization’ Quite Differently,” New York
[NKREA|09E8]Times, June 10, 2018.


[NKREA|09E9]The two sides
[NKREA|09EA]agreed to conduct follow-on negotiations.


[NKREA|09EB]In a solo press conference
[NKREA|09EC]after his 
[NKREA|09ED]meeting with Kim, Trump
[NKREA|09EE]announced that the
[NKREA|09EF]United States would suspend annual
[NKREA|09F0]U.S.-South  Korea military
[NKREA|09F1]exercises, which Trump
[NKREA|09F2]called “war games,” “unless
[NKREA|09F3]and until we see
[NKREA|09F4]the future  negotiation
[NKREA|09F5]is not going along
[NKREA|09F6]like it should.”61 Then-National Security
[NKREA|09F7]Advisor John Bolton
[NKREA|09F8]later 
[NKREA|09F9]revealed that Kim
[NKREA|09FA]asked Trump to scale back
[NKREA|09FB]or eliminate the exercises, to
[NKREA|09FC]which Trump  reportedly
[NKREA|09FD]replied that the exercises were
[NKREA|09FE]“provocative and a waste
[NKREA|09FF]of time and money.” 
[NKREA|0A00]According to Bolton, Trump did
[NKREA|0A01]not consult with any
[NKREA|0A02]of his advisors,
[NKREA|0A03]or with the Department
[NKREA|0A04]of  Defense,
[NKREA|0A05]before making the decision.62
[NKREA|0A06]The Singapore Declaration
[NKREA|0A07]made no mention
[NKREA|0A08]of the  DPRK’s
[NKREA|0A09]ballistic missile program.


[NKREA|0A0A]It also did
[NKREA|0A0B]not contain a
[NKREA|0A0C]timeframe for implementation
[NKREA|0A0D]or any  reference
[NKREA|0A0E]to verification mechanisms
[NKREA|0A0F]for the denuclearization process.


[NKREA|0A10]The definition of 
[NKREA|0A11]denuclearization, as well
[NKREA|0A12]as the sequencing
[NKREA|0A13]of the process
[NKREA|0A14]of denuclearizing, establishing
[NKREA|0A15]a peace  regime,
[NKREA|0A16]removing economic restrictions,
[NKREA|0A17]and normalizing diplomatic ties were
[NKREA|0A18]left unstated.63  
[NKREA|0A19]This vagueness may
[NKREA|0A1A]have contributed to
[NKREA|0A1B]the subsequent lack
[NKREA|0A1C]of progress in
[NKREA|0A1D]implementing most  aspects
[NKREA|0A1E]of the agreement.


[NKREA|0A1F]In the weeks
[NKREA|0A20]following the summit, it
[NKREA|0A21]appeared that North Korea was
[NKREA|0A22]looking for the
[NKREA|0A23]United States to take tangible
[NKREA|0A24]steps to establish
[NKREA|0A25]a new relationship
[NKREA|0A26]and a peace 
[NKREA|0A27]regime.


[NKREA|0A28]Meanwhile, the United States was
[NKREA|0A29]looking for North Korea to
[NKREA|0A2A]take concrete  denuclearization
[NKREA|0A2B]steps before moving ahead
[NKREA|0A2C]with other actions.


[NKREA|0A2D]For months, U.S.-DPRK 
[NKREA|0A2E]diplomacy largely appeared to stall.


[NKREA|0A2F]The only tangible public step
[NKREA|0A30]toward implementing the 
[NKREA|0A31]Singapore Declaration was
[NKREA|0A32]the July 2018 North Korean
[NKREA|0A33]delivery of 55 cases
[NKREA|0A34]of remains of 
[NKREA|0A35]possible U.S. armed services members
[NKREA|0A36]missing in the Korean War.


[NKREA|0A37]Despite continued professions 
[NKREA|0A38]of personal respect
[NKREA|0A39]and goodwill between Trump
[NKREA|0A3A]and Kim, including
[NKREA|0A3B]the exchange of effusive 
[NKREA|0A3C]personal letters between
[NKREA|0A3D]the leaders, the two sides
[NKREA|0A3E]did not publicly hold official
[NKREA|0A3F]working-level  talks
[NKREA|0A40]regarding denuclearization until January 2019.64
[NKREA|0A41]64 Trump and Kim reportedly
[NKREA|0A42]exchanged 27 letters in 2018
[NKREA|0A43]and 2019.

[NKREA|0A45]Simon and  Schuster,

[NKREA|0A47]At a September 28, 2018
[NKREA|0A48]political rally in West Virginia,
[NKREA|0A49]President Trump said that he
[NKREA|0A4A]and  North Korean
[NKREA|0A4B]leader Kim Jong Un “fell
[NKREA|0A4C]in love,” and that Kim
[NKREA|0A4D]writes him “beautiful letters.”

[NKREA|0A54]65 In September 2018,
[NKREA|0A55]for example, the Department
[NKREA|0A56]of the Treasury’s Office
[NKREA|0A57]of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence
[NKREA|0A58]reportedly called executives in charge
[NKREA|0A59]of compliance at seven South
[NKREA|0A5A]Korean banks expressing “concern” about
[NKREA|0A5B]rumored  financial cooperation
[NKREA|0A5C]between the two Koreas,
[NKREA|0A5D]and to issue reminders about
[NKREA|0A5E]U.N.

[NKREA|0A65]In November 2023,
[NKREA|0A66]the Comprehensive Military Agreement
[NKREA|0A67]appeared to collapse.


[NKREA|0A68]Following North Korea’s launch
[NKREA|0A69]of a  spy
[NKREA|0A6A]satellite that month, South Korea
[NKREA|0A6B]announced it was
[NKREA|0A6C]suspending its adherence to
[NKREA|0A6D]the agreement’s prohibition on 
[NKREA|0A6E]conducting aerial surveillance
[NKREA|0A6F]of the DMZ.


[NKREA|0A70]North Korea responded
[NKREA|0A71]by announcing it
[NKREA|0A72]would no longer abide
[NKREA|0A73]by the  agreement
[NKREA|0A74]in its totality.

[NKREA|0A79]Launch, Seoul Says,”
[NKREA|0A7A]Associated Press, November 27, 2023.


[NKREA|0A7B]The military agreement’s collapse
[NKREA|0A7C]represented the crumbling
[NKREA|0A7D]of another foundation
[NKREA|0A7E]of the 2018-2019 inter-Korean 
[NKREA|0A7F]rapprochement.


[NKREA|0A80]In June 2020,
[NKREA|0A81]for instance, North Korea
[NKREA|0A82]detonated the building
[NKREA|0A83]hosting an inter-Korean liaison office
[NKREA|0A84]following a private South Korean
[NKREA|0A85]group launching balloons
[NKREA|0A86]containing anti-Kim propaganda leaflets across
[NKREA|0A87]the DMZ.


[NKREA|0A88]The liaison office,
[NKREA|0A89]the establishment of
[NKREA|0A8A]which was an outcome
[NKREA|0A8B]of the April 2018 Moon-Kim
[NKREA|0A8C]summit, had been
[NKREA|0A8D]the first- ever channel
[NKREA|0A8E]for full-time, person-to-person contact between
[NKREA|0A8F]the two Koreas.


[NKREA|0A90]66 It is unclear to
[NKREA|0A91]what extent the Trump Administration
[NKREA|0A92]factored into its approach
[NKREA|0A93]the restrictions that U.S. law
[NKREA|0A94]imposes  on
[NKREA|0A95]the President’s ability to suspend
[NKREA|0A96]or terminate—and in some cases
[NKREA|0A97]waive—sanctions against North Korea.

[NKREA|0AB8]also signed a Comprehensive Military
[NKREA|0AB9]Agreement in which they
[NKREA|0ABA]agreed to reestablish communications links
[NKREA|0ABB]to prevent accidental 
[NKREA|0ABC]military clashes, create
[NKREA|0ABD]a no-fly zone along
[NKREA|0ABE]the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between
[NKREA|0ABF]the two  Koreas,
[NKREA|0AC0]withdraw many of their guard
[NKREA|0AC1]posts within the DMZ,
[NKREA|0AC2]and create in effect
[NKREA|0AC3]a “no military 
[NKREA|0AC4]drills zone” and
[NKREA|0AC5]a joint fishing zone in
[NKREA|0AC6]the Yellow Sea.


[NKREA|0AC7]Moon’s pre- and post-summit attempts
[NKREA|0AC8]to  accelerate various
[NKREA|0AC9]inter-Korean projects appeared to cause
[NKREA|0ACA]tensions with many U.S. officials,
[NKREA|0ACB]who 
[NKREA|0ACC]expressed concerns that they
[NKREA|0ACD]would violate the spirit
[NKREA|0ACE]and even the letter
[NKREA|0ACF]of U.N.


[NKREA|0AD0]and U.S.  sanctions.65
[NKREA|0AD1]February 2019 Hanoi Summit 
[NKREA|0AD2]After months with scant progress
[NKREA|0AD3]in U.S.-DPRK negotiations, momentum built
[NKREA|0AD4]toward a second 
[NKREA|0AD5]Trump-Kim summit.


[NKREA|0AD6]The two leaders met
[NKREA|0AD7]over two days in February
[NKREA|0AD8]2019 in Vietnam’s capital, 
[NKREA|0AD9]Hanoi.


[NKREA|0ADA]However, the summit
[NKREA|0ADB]ended without an agreement due
[NKREA|0ADC]to disagreements about
[NKREA|0ADD]the timing 
[NKREA|0ADE]and sequencing of concessions, specifically
[NKREA|0ADF]DPRK denuclearization measures in exchange
[NKREA|0AE0]for  sanctions relief.66
[NKREA|0AE1]North Korean officials
[NKREA|0AE2]said they had
[NKREA|0AE3]offered to shut down fissile
[NKREA|0AE4]material  production facilities
[NKREA|0AE5]at the Yongbyon nuclear complex
[NKREA|0AE6]and proposed that U.S. technical
[NKREA|0AE7]inspectors  come to
[NKREA|0AE8]monitor the shuttering.67 U.S. intelligence

[NKREA|0B28]A few days later, 
[NKREA|0B29]the Administration announced it
[NKREA|0B2A]would permanently halt large-scale U.S.-South
[NKREA|0B2B]Korean military exercises, due to
[NKREA|0B2C]their  expense,
[NKREA|0B2D]and instead hold smaller, lower-profile
[NKREA|0B2E]exercises.


[NKREA|0B2F]Prior to Trump’s original suspension
[NKREA|0B30]of the exercises, U.S. 
[NKREA|0B31]defense officials said that
[NKREA|0B32]the annual large-scale exercises were
[NKREA|0B33]critical to maintaining military readiness.


[NKREA|0B34]Nancy A.  
[NKREA|0B35]Special Representative for North Korea
[NKREA|0B36]Stephen Biegun said that disclosure
[NKREA|0B37]of enrichment sites 
[NKREA|0B38]other than Yongbyon was to
[NKREA|0B39]be a key part
[NKREA|0B3A]of negotiations.69 President Trump in
[NKREA|0B3B]his post-summit  remarks
[NKREA|0B3C]referred to a lack
[NKREA|0B3D]of agreement on North Korean
[NKREA|0B3E]disclosure of a
[NKREA|0B3F]second uranium  enrichment
[NKREA|0B40]plant.70  
[NKREA|0B41]The two sides
[NKREA|0B42]appeared to be particularly far
[NKREA|0B43]apart on the issue
[NKREA|0B44]of sanctions relief.


[NKREA|0B45]North Korea 
[NKREA|0B46]asked for relief from
[NKREA|0B47]the UNSC sanctions
[NKREA|0B48]imposed since 2016 that target
[NKREA|0B49]its export of coal, iron,
[NKREA|0B4A]textiles, seafood, and other minerals;


[NKREA|0B4B]imports of petroleum;


[NKREA|0B4C]and other restrictions on economic
[NKREA|0B4D]interactions with North Korean industries.


[NKREA|0B4E]The United States
[NKREA|0B4F]rejected this proposal,
[NKREA|0B50]which would 
[NKREA|0B51]have left in place
[NKREA|0B52]only sanctions that restrict imports
[NKREA|0B53]of arms, dual-use items,
[NKREA|0B54]and luxury goods.


[NKREA|0B55]Bolton reports that Kim
[NKREA|0B56]rejected Trump’s suggestion that North
[NKREA|0B57]Korea receive a percentage 
[NKREA|0B58]reduction in the sanctions, rather
[NKREA|0B59]than their near-complete removal.71 
[NKREA|0B5A]There are also questions about
[NKREA|0B5B]the unity of
[NKREA|0B5C]and coordination among top Trump
[NKREA|0B5D]Administration  officials
[NKREA|0B5E]participating in the negotiations.


[NKREA|0B5F]In his memoir, Bolton describes
[NKREA|0B60]his opposition to
[NKREA|0B61]the  summit process
[NKREA|0B62]as well as
[NKREA|0B63]the ways he
[NKREA|0B64]attempted to derail
[NKREA|0B65]what he called
[NKREA|0B66]the “unhealthy  negotiation
[NKREA|0B67]path” that the State Department
[NKREA|0B68]was pursuing, including
[NKREA|0B69]by persuading Trump in pre-
[NKREA|0B6A]summit briefings of
[NKREA|0B6B]the attractiveness of
[NKREA|0B6C]walking away from
[NKREA|0B6D]the talks without
[NKREA|0B6E]a deal.72  
[NKREA|0B6F]Following the breakdown
[NKREA|0B70]of the summit, Pompeo
[NKREA|0B71]and other U.S. officials
[NKREA|0B72]said that the two sides
[NKREA|0B73]made progress at Hanoi on
[NKREA|0B74]other issues.73 These appear to
[NKREA|0B75]include proposals relating to
[NKREA|0B76]the  establishment
[NKREA|0B77]of liaison offices, issuance
[NKREA|0B78]of a peace declaration, recovery
[NKREA|0B79]of the remains
[NKREA|0B7A]of U.S.  soldiers
[NKREA|0B7B]missing from the Korean War,
[NKREA|0B7C]and opening channels
[NKREA|0B7D]for dialogue between Korean- 
[NKREA|0B7E]Americans and their families inside
[NKREA|0B7F]North Korea.


[NKREA|0B80]None of these apparent points
[NKREA|0B81]of agreement,  however,
[NKREA|0B82]was finalized, in part due
[NKREA|0B83]to a U.S. decision that
[NKREA|0B84]progress in these areas
[NKREA|0B85]must move “in 
[NKREA|0B86]parallel” with progress in denuclearization
[NKREA|0B87]talks.74 According to Trump
[NKREA|0B88]and Pompeo, Kim 
[NKREA|0B89]promised to maintain
[NKREA|0B8A]the unilateral moratorium on nuclear
[NKREA|0B8B]and missile tests that North
[NKREA|0B8C]Korea had 
[NKREA|0B8D]maintained since late November 2017.


[NKREA|0B8E]In turn, Trump
[NKREA|0B8F]promised to continue
[NKREA|0B90]suspending U.S.- South Korean
[NKREA|0B91]military exercises.75

[NKREA|0B96]According to then-commander

[NKREA|0B98]Korea, in the months

[NKREA|0BDB]It is not clear
[NKREA|0BDC]whether U.S. government officials directly
[NKREA|0BDD]interacted with their North Korean
[NKREA|0BDE]counterparts in the summer 
[NKREA|0BDF]The Hanoi summit
[NKREA|0BE0]marked a turning point in
[NKREA|0BE1]U.S.-DPRK negotiations.


[NKREA|0BE2]Thereafter, North Korea’s 
[NKREA|0BE3]stance hardened significantly, perhaps due
[NKREA|0BE4]to a belief that Pyongyang
[NKREA|0BE5]had achieved little in
[NKREA|0BE6]the  way
[NKREA|0BE7]of establishing either
[NKREA|0BE8]a new relationship
[NKREA|0BE9]with the United States
[NKREA|0BEA]or a declaration
[NKREA|0BEB]of the end
[NKREA|0BEC]of 
[NKREA|0BED]the Korean War.


[NKREA|0BEE]Perhaps most important, North Korea
[NKREA|0BEF]did not receive promises
[NKREA|0BF0]of sanctions  relief.76
[NKREA|0BF1]In May 2019, North Korea
[NKREA|0BF2]resumed testing short-range ballistic missiles
[NKREA|0BF3](SRBM), 
[NKREA|0BF4]conducting over a dozen such
[NKREA|0BF5]tests in 2019, 2020,
[NKREA|0BF6]and 2021, in violation
[NKREA|0BF7]of U.N.


[NKREA|0BF8]prohibitions.


[NKREA|0BF9]The tests likely
[NKREA|0BFA]have advanced the reliability
[NKREA|0BFB]and precision of North Korea’s
[NKREA|0BFC]missile forces and 
[NKREA|0BFD]improved its capabilities to defeat
[NKREA|0BFE]regional missile defense systems.


[NKREA|0BFF]In late December 2019, Kim
[NKREA|0C00]announced that, due to U.S.
[NKREA|0C01]policies “to completely strangle
[NKREA|0C02]and stifle the DPRK …
[NKREA|0C03]there is no 
[NKREA|0C04]ground” for North Korea to
[NKREA|0C05]continue to maintain its nuclear
[NKREA|0C06]and missile testing moratorium.


[NKREA|0C07]Kim 
[NKREA|0C08]criticized the United States’ continuation
[NKREA|0C09]of sanctions, smaller military exercises
[NKREA|0C0A]with South  Korea,
[NKREA|0C0B]and shipments of
[NKREA|0C0C]advanced military equipment to South
[NKREA|0C0D]Korea and warned that “the
[NKREA|0C0E]world 
[NKREA|0C0F]will witness a new strategic
[NKREA|0C10]weapon to be
[NKREA|0C11]possessed by the DPRK in
[NKREA|0C12]the near future.”77 
[NKREA|0C13]Aside from a one-hour, quickly
[NKREA|0C14]arranged June 2019
[NKREA|0C15]meeting between Trump
[NKREA|0C16]and Kim in 
[NKREA|0C17]Panmunjom, the United States
[NKREA|0C18]and North Korea
[NKREA|0C19]have held one round
[NKREA|0C1A]of official talks
[NKREA|0C1B]since the  Hanoi
[NKREA|0C1C]summit, in October 2019.


[NKREA|0C1D]Trump Administration officials
[NKREA|0C1E]say their North Korean 
[NKREA|0C1F]counterparts refused to engage in
[NKREA|0C20]additional negotiations.


[NKREA|0C21]North Korea also
[NKREA|0C22]halted virtually all 
[NKREA|0C23]forms of cooperation
[NKREA|0C24]with South Korea.


[NKREA|0C25]The Trump Administration
[NKREA|0C26]continued to issue sanctions 
[NKREA|0C27]designations and, to some extent,
[NKREA|0C28]pushed back on PRC, Russian,
[NKREA|0C29]and South Korean proposals to
[NKREA|0C2A]ease sanctions.


[NKREA|0C2B]Throughout the remainder
[NKREA|0C2C]of its term, however,
[NKREA|0C2D]the Administration refrained from 
[NKREA|0C2E]aggressively using available sanctions authorities
[NKREA|0C2F]particularly against entities in third
[NKREA|0C30]countries, 
[NKREA|0C31]continued its halt
[NKREA|0C32]of large-scale joint military exercises
[NKREA|0C33]with South Korea,
[NKREA|0C34]and did not issue high-
[NKREA|0C35]profile criticism of DPRK human
[NKREA|0C36]rights violations.78 North Korea’s
[NKREA|0C37]reported refusal to engage 
[NKREA|0C38]with the United States
[NKREA|0C39]and South Korea
[NKREA|0C3A]continued through the remainder
[NKREA|0C3B]of the Trump 
[NKREA|0C3C]Administration.


[NKREA|0C3D]In late March 2021,
[NKREA|0C3E]the Biden Administration
[NKREA|0C3F]disclosed that U.S. officials
[NKREA|0C40]had reached out to 
[NKREA|0C41]North Korea through
[NKREA|0C42]several channels starting in mid-February
[NKREA|0C43]but had not
[NKREA|0C44]received a response,
[NKREA|0C45]a  dynamic Administration

[NKREA|0C4A]secure the release
[NKREA|0C4B]of U.S. private Travis King.


[NKREA|0C4C]In July 2023, King fled
[NKREA|0C4D]to North Korea.


[NKREA|0C4E]North Korea 
[NKREA|0C4F]released him in September.


[NKREA|0C50]Following King’s release, U.S. officials
[NKREA|0C51]stated they had “been
[NKREA|0C52]reaching out” to North Korea
[NKREA|0C53]“through multiple channels,”
[NKREA|0C54]including “at the
[NKREA|0C55]United Nations and through our
[NKREA|0C56]United Nations Command.” It appears
[NKREA|0C57]that much of
[NKREA|0C58]the communication between
[NKREA|0C59]the two governments to handle
[NKREA|0C5A]the King incident
[NKREA|0C5B]occurred via the Swedish

[NKREA|0C8D]Sections 7101-7155, National Defense Authorization
[NKREA|0C8E]Act for FY2020),
[NKREA|0C8F]the President is
[NKREA|0C90]authorized to suspend
[NKREA|0C91]or  terminate many
[NKREA|0C92]sanctions against North Korea
[NKREA|0C93]if he or she certifies
[NKREA|0C94]that North Korea
[NKREA|0C95]has made progress in
[NKREA|0C96]a number of 
[NKREA|0C97]areas, including in human rights
[NKREA|0C98]and in the abandonment
[NKREA|0C99]of its nuclear
[NKREA|0C9A]and missile programs.

[NKREA|0C9D]and Section 402 (22 U.S.C.


[NKREA|0C9E]§9251 and §9252).


[NKREA|0C9F]The President may waive
[NKREA|0CA0]the application of many sanctions
[NKREA|0CA1]if he or she certifies
[NKREA|0CA2]either that a waiver is
[NKREA|0CA3]“vital” to U.S. 
[NKREA|0CA4]has characterized U.S. offers
[NKREA|0CA5]of diplomacy as “no
[NKREA|0CA6]more than a petty trick
[NKREA|0CA7]for deceiving the 
[NKREA|0CA8]international community and
[NKREA|0CA9]hiding its hostile acts,” specifically
[NKREA|0CAA]the continuation of U.S.-ROK 
[NKREA|0CAB]military exercises, the maintenance
[NKREA|0CAC]of sanctions against North Korea,
[NKREA|0CAD]and South Korean 
[NKREA|0CAE]acquisition of and advances in
[NKREA|0CAF]indigenous sophisticated military equipment.80 North
[NKREA|0CB0]Korea also  generally
[NKREA|0CB1]has ignored South Korean offers
[NKREA|0CB2]of aid, cooperation,
[NKREA|0CB3]and diplomatic engagement.


[NKREA|0CB4]Future Considerations and Issues
[NKREA|0CB5]for Congress  
[NKREA|0CB6]If the Biden Administration
[NKREA|0CB7]and the Kim regime enter
[NKREA|0CB8]into diplomatic talks, it is
[NKREA|0CB9]unclear whether  they
[NKREA|0CBA]will choose to build on
[NKREA|0CBB]the Trump-Kim Singapore Declaration, resurrect
[NKREA|0CBC]elements of  previous
[NKREA|0CBD]agreements, and/or chart new ground.81
[NKREA|0CBE]Paths forward could include elements
[NKREA|0CBF]such as  
[NKREA|0CC0]• a formal international agreement
[NKREA|0CC1]on halting nuclear
[NKREA|0CC2]and missile tests;


[NKREA|0CC3]• a DPRK freeze on
[NKREA|0CC4]production of nuclear material, and/or
[NKREA|0CC5]the dismantlement of 
[NKREA|0CC6]nuclear facilities;


[NKREA|0CC7]• a DPRK declaration
[NKREA|0CC8]of weapons stocks, international
[NKREA|0CC9]monitoring and verification;


[NKREA|0CCA]• DPRK pledges
[NKREA|0CCB]not to sell missile components
[NKREA|0CCC]or nuclear materials to other
[NKREA|0CCD]countries;


[NKREA|0CCE]and  •
[NKREA|0CCF]a wide range
[NKREA|0CD0]of diplomatic agreements such
[NKREA|0CD1]as a declaration
[NKREA|0CD2]of an end to
[NKREA|0CD3]the  Korean War
[NKREA|0CD4]and/or the opening
[NKREA|0CD5]of U.S. and DPRK liaison
[NKREA|0CD6]offices, among other 
[NKREA|0CD7]items.


[NKREA|0CD8]Additionally, the possibility
[NKREA|0CD9]of the United States
[NKREA|0CDA]offering sanctions relief is
[NKREA|0CDB]complicated by,  among
[NKREA|0CDC]other factors, legal requirements Congress
[NKREA|0CDD]passed and Presidents Obama
[NKREA|0CDE]and Trump 
[NKREA|0CDF]signed in 2016, 2017,
[NKREA|0CE0]and 2019 (P.L.

[NKREA|0CE2]115-44, and P.L.


[NKREA|0CE3]116-92) to address
[NKREA|0CE4]a range of 
[NKREA|0CE5]security, regional stability, human rights,
[NKREA|0CE6]and governance issues
[NKREA|0CE7]before sanctions can be 
[NKREA|0CE8]suspended or altogether terminated.


[NKREA|0CE9]U.S. sanctions on North Korea
[NKREA|0CEA]target not just weapons 
[NKREA|0CEB]development but also human rights
[NKREA|0CEC]abuses, money laundering, illicit weapons
[NKREA|0CED]trade, international  terrorism,
[NKREA|0CEE]and illicit cyber operations.82 
[NKREA|0CEF]national security interests
[NKREA|0CF0]or that a) North Korea
[NKREA|0CF1]has committed to suspend its
[NKREA|0CF2]proliferation and testing
[NKREA|0CF3]of WMD and b) 
[NKREA|0CF4]has agreed to engage in
[NKREA|0CF5]multilateral talks to limit its
[NKREA|0CF6]WMD programs.

[NKREA|0D2A]If talks resume under
[NKREA|0D2B]the Biden Administration, they
[NKREA|0D2C]would be resumed in
[NKREA|0D2D]the context of 
[NKREA|0D2E]Pyongyang having further
[NKREA|0D2F]advanced its nuclear
[NKREA|0D30]and missile programs
[NKREA|0D31]since the first Trump-era 
[NKREA|0D32]summit, and in
[NKREA|0D33]a regional environment in
[NKREA|0D34]which North Korea’s relationships
[NKREA|0D35]with neighboring  China,
[NKREA|0D36]Russia, and to
[NKREA|0D37]a lesser extent, South Korea,
[NKREA|0D38]have substantially changed.


[NKREA|0D39]Improved North  Korea-China
[NKREA|0D3A]and North Korea-Russia relations
[NKREA|0D3B]since 2018 arguably
[NKREA|0D3C]have made it easier
[NKREA|0D3D]for all  actors
[NKREA|0D3E]to evade sanctions
[NKREA|0D3F]and made it
[NKREA|0D40]more difficult for
[NKREA|0D41]the United States to find
[NKREA|0D42]international  support
[NKREA|0D43]needed to impose new sanctions.83
[NKREA|0D44]Additionally, Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion
[NKREA|0D45]of Ukraine and
[NKREA|0D46]the increased strains in U.S.-China
[NKREA|0D47]relations since the late 2010s
[NKREA|0D48]could be providing Kim
[NKREA|0D49]more room to maneuver, greater
[NKREA|0D4A]ability to  evade
[NKREA|0D4B]sanctions, and possibly
[NKREA|0D4C]more opportunities for economic, financial,
[NKREA|0D4D]and military resources 
[NKREA|0D4E]in the form
[NKREA|0D4F]of future assistance from,
[NKREA|0D50]as well as trade
[NKREA|0D51]and cooperation with Moscow and/or
[NKREA|0D52]Beijing.


[NKREA|0D53]PRC and Russian vetoes
[NKREA|0D54]of U.S.-led efforts at
[NKREA|0D55]the UNSC in May 2022
[NKREA|0D56]to adopt stricter 
[NKREA|0D57]sanctions on Pyongyang
[NKREA|0D58]after the DPRK’s intercontinental ballistic
[NKREA|0D59]missile (ICBM) tests are one
[NKREA|0D5A]indication that North Korea may
[NKREA|0D5B]be benefiting from
[NKREA|0D5C]the contemporary geopolitical environment.


[NKREA|0D5D]North Korea-Russia relations appear to
[NKREA|0D5E]have taken a significant step
[NKREA|0D5F]forward in 2023.


[NKREA|0D60]In  September
[NKREA|0D61]of that year, Kim
[NKREA|0D62]visited the Russian Far East
[NKREA|0D63]for his first trip outside
[NKREA|0D64]of North Korea 
[NKREA|0D65]since 2019, during
[NKREA|0D66]which he met
[NKREA|0D67]with Russian President Vladimir Putin.


[NKREA|0D68]The Biden  Administration
[NKREA|0D69]has accused North Korea
[NKREA|0D6A]of providing Russia
[NKREA|0D6B]with North Korean rockets
[NKREA|0D6C]and  artillery shells
[NKREA|0D6D]for use in Ukraine.84 
[NKREA|0D6E]Future talks undoubtedly
[NKREA|0D6F]would have to take into
[NKREA|0D70]consideration North Korean military advances
[NKREA|0D71]since 2019.


[NKREA|0D72]In the ensuing years, North
[NKREA|0D73]Korea appears to
[NKREA|0D74]have advanced key aspects
[NKREA|0D75]of its  military
[NKREA|0D76]capabilities, particularly in
[NKREA|0D77]the reliability and precision
[NKREA|0D78]of its missile forces.


[NKREA|0D79]North Korea 
[NKREA|0D7A]has conducted more
[NKREA|0D7B]than 100 ballistic missile tests
[NKREA|0D7C]in that time, in violation
[NKREA|0D7D]of UNSC  requirements.


[NKREA|0D7E]North Korea also is
[NKREA|0D7F]believed to have
[NKREA|0D80]made advances in its nuclear
[NKREA|0D81]weapons  development
[NKREA|0D82]and has issued statements that
[NKREA|0D83]it will not relinquish such
[NKREA|0D84]weapons.85 Some analysts 
[NKREA|0D85]have expressed concern that North
[NKREA|0D86]Korea’s growing missile capabilities
[NKREA|0D87]will give it greater 
[NKREA|0D88]confidence to conduct aggressive diplomatic,
[NKREA|0D89]military, or other actions to
[NKREA|0D8A]achieve its objectives.86 
[NKREA|0D8B]U.S. officials also
[NKREA|0D8C]have voiced concerns about Pyongyang’s
[NKREA|0D8D]improving cyber capabilities,
[NKREA|0D8E]which 
[NKREA|0D8F]the regime could use
[NKREA|0D90]for retaliation, coercion, espionage,
[NKREA|0D91]or sabotage, in addition to
[NKREA|0D92]the estimated  hundreds
[NKREA|0D93]of millions of dollars it
[NKREA|0D94]reportedly has stolen
[NKREA|0D95]by way of cybertheft.87 
[NKREA|0D96]The apparently severe economic difficulties
[NKREA|0D97]that North Korea
[NKREA|0D98]experienced from 2020 to 2023
[NKREA|0D99]due  to its
[NKREA|0D9A]COVID-19-related shutdowns of its border
[NKREA|0D9B]did not create openings
[NKREA|0D9C]for U.S. diplomacy 
[NKREA|0D9D]and/or economic pressure.


[NKREA|0D9E]North Korea’s end to its
[NKREA|0D9F]self-imposed isolation in 2023 removes
[NKREA|0DA0]a  logistical obstacle
[NKREA|0DA1]to dialogue, should Kim Jong
[NKREA|0DA2]Un decide to engage.


[NKREA|0DA3]In the past, North Korea
[NKREA|0DA4]has pivoted to diplomatic outreach
[NKREA|0DA5]following periods of tension.88
[NKREA|0DA6]As discussed below, many 
[NKREA|0DA7]observers see little value in
[NKREA|0DA8]further negotiations, as they doubt
[NKREA|0DA9]that North Korea
[NKREA|0DAA]will be willing to 
[NKREA|0DAB]accept any limits on its
[NKREA|0DAC]nuclear and missile programs.

[NKREA|0DE9]It Might Be
[NKREA|0DEA]More Than  
[NKREA|0DEB]Utility or Futility
[NKREA|0DEC]of Negotiations?  
[NKREA|0DED]The utility of
[NKREA|0DEE]negotiating with North Korea is
[NKREA|0DEF]heavily debated.


[NKREA|0DF0]Some analysts argue that it
[NKREA|0DF1]is a  “delusion”
[NKREA|0DF2]to believe that direct negotiations
[NKREA|0DF3]with Pyongyang will lead
[NKREA|0DF4]the Kim regime to 
[NKREA|0DF5]voluntarily denuclearize.89 Others contend
[NKREA|0DF6]not only that negotiations are
[NKREA|0DF7]necessary to reduce
[NKREA|0DF8]the  chances
[NKREA|0DF9]of conflict, but
[NKREA|0DFA]also that they are feasible,
[NKREA|0DFB]because Kim Jong Un’s “real
[NKREA|0DFC]goal is economic 
[NKREA|0DFD]development.”90 Others posit that North
[NKREA|0DFE]Korea’s WMD programs are
[NKREA|0DFF]motivated in large measure 
[NKREA|0E00]by the threat Pyongyang perceives
[NKREA|0E01]from the United States’ “hostile
[NKREA|0E02]policy,” and therefore U.S. 
[NKREA|0E03]measures to reduce
[NKREA|0E04]the threat—such as
[NKREA|0E05]declaring an end to
[NKREA|0E06]the Korean War
[NKREA|0E07]and signing a peace 
[NKREA|0E08]treaty—and build bilateral trust
[NKREA|0E09]and confidence are necessary.91
[NKREA|0E0A]Implied in this is
[NKREA|0E0B]the concept of
[NKREA|0E0C]a  basic bargain
[NKREA|0E0D]of economic benefits, sanctions easing,
[NKREA|0E0E]and security assurances in exchange
[NKREA|0E0F]for  nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0E10]and missile limitations
[NKREA|0E11]or dismantlement.


[NKREA|0E12]However, statutory conditions
[NKREA|0E13]placed  upon
[NKREA|0E14]the President’s ability to suspend
[NKREA|0E15]or terminate—and in some cases
[NKREA|0E16]waive—sanctions impose  constraints
[NKREA|0E17]on the U.S. scope
[NKREA|0E18]for action in this regard.


[NKREA|0E19]The prevailing view among U.S.
[NKREA|0E1A]North Korea watchers is that
[NKREA|0E1B]the North Korean regime, 
[NKREA|0E1C]regardless of inducements,
[NKREA|0E1D]will not voluntarily give up
[NKREA|0E1E]its nuclear weapons capability.


[NKREA|0E1F]Since the  breakdown
[NKREA|0E20]of the Trump-Kim diplomacy in
[NKREA|0E21]2019, Kim has
[NKREA|0E22]issued statements that he
[NKREA|0E23]will not  relinquish
[NKREA|0E24]such weapons.92 The U.S. intelligence
[NKREA|0E25]community concurs with this assessment,
[NKREA|0E26]stating  in 2023
[NKREA|0E27]that “Kim almost
[NKREA|0E28]certainly views nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0E29]and ICBMs as
[NKREA|0E2A]the ultimate guarantor 
[NKREA|0E2B]of his autocratic rule
[NKREA|0E2C]and has no intention
[NKREA|0E2D]of abandoning those programs,
[NKREA|0E2E]believing that over
[NKREA|0E2F]time  he
[NKREA|0E30]will gain international acceptance
[NKREA|0E31]as a nuclear power.”93
[NKREA|0E32]The U.S. intelligence community
[NKREA|0E33]also 
[NKREA|0E34]has expressed concern that North
[NKREA|0E35]Korea’s growing missile capabilities
[NKREA|0E36]will give it greater 
[NKREA|0E37]confidence to conduct aggressive diplomatic,
[NKREA|0E38]military, or other actions to
[NKREA|0E39]achieve its objectives.94 
[NKREA|0E3A]Some North Korea analysts believe
[NKREA|0E3B]that the DPRK may calculate
[NKREA|0E3C]that acquiring the ability to
[NKREA|0E3D]strike U.S. territory
[NKREA|0E3E]with nuclear-tipped ICBMs
[NKREA|0E3F]will increase Pyongyang’s chances
[NKREA|0E40]of achieving  its
[NKREA|0E41]ultimate goal of
[NKREA|0E42]reunifying the Korean Peninsula.95 Kim

[NKREA|0E54]For  example, North
[NKREA|0E55]Korea developed an

[NKREA|0E59]measures toward the end
[NKREA|0E5A]of the Six Party Talks
[NKREA|0E5B]agreements;

[NKREA|0E6B]had “just bought them

[NKREA|0E9E]political motivations for aggressively
[NKREA|0E9F]pushing the development
[NKREA|0EA0]of the DPRK’s nuclear
[NKREA|0EA1]and  missile programs.


[NKREA|0EA2]To many critics, North Korea’s
[NKREA|0EA3]record of pulling out
[NKREA|0EA4]of or not
[NKREA|0EA5]abiding by past agreements proves
[NKREA|0EA6]that Pyongyang was
[NKREA|0EA7]never committed to full denuclearization,
[NKREA|0EA8]and reaped benefits
[NKREA|0EA9]and bought 
[NKREA|0EAA]time while secretly
[NKREA|0EAB]advancing its nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0EAC]and missile programs.96 This
[NKREA|0EAD]has led to
[NKREA|0EAE]a  debate in
[NKREA|0EAF]North Korea policy circles about
[NKREA|0EB0]how to avoid scenarios in
[NKREA|0EB1]which North Korea pulls out
[NKREA|0EB2]of or is
[NKREA|0EB3]not fully committed to an
[NKREA|0EB4]agreement.97 Additionally, some argue that
[NKREA|0EB5]as North Korea
[NKREA|0EB6]has 
[NKREA|0EB7]achieved certain technical milestones,
[NKREA|0EB8]a freeze may
[NKREA|0EB9]no longer be
[NKREA|0EBA]a relevant solution,
[NKREA|0EBB]and there is
[NKREA|0EBC]a  risk
[NKREA|0EBD]of the Kim regime
[NKREA|0EBE]continuing to build up its
[NKREA|0EBF]arsenal, perhaps secretly,
[NKREA|0EC0]while negotiations are 
[NKREA|0EC1]ongoing.98  
[NKREA|0EC2]Another camp, while generally
[NKREA|0EC3]not optimistic about
[NKREA|0EC4]the prospects of negotiations
[NKREA|0EC5]achieving full  denuclearization,
[NKREA|0EC6]argues that talks
[NKREA|0EC7]can still produce tangible security
[NKREA|0EC8]benefits to the
[NKREA|0EC9]United States, 
[NKREA|0ECA]and warn that
[NKREA|0ECB]if North Korea’s WMD programs
[NKREA|0ECC]are left unchecked, they
[NKREA|0ECD]will become an
[NKREA|0ECE]even  greater threat
[NKREA|0ECF]to the United States
[NKREA|0ED0]and its allies.99 Those in
[NKREA|0ED1]this group argue that previous
[NKREA|0ED2]agreements with North Korea
[NKREA|0ED3]have resulted in significant,
[NKREA|0ED4]if temporary, benefits.


[NKREA|0ED5]The Agreed  Framework
[NKREA|0ED6]slowed North Korea’s nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0ED7]development by shutting down plutonium
[NKREA|0ED8]nuclear facilities at its Yongbyon
[NKREA|0ED9]nuclear complex from 1994 to
[NKREA|0EDA]2002 and subjecting
[NKREA|0EDB]the complex  to
[NKREA|0EDC]continuous international monitoring.


[NKREA|0EDD]Between 1999 and 2006, North
[NKREA|0EDE]Korea abided by
[NKREA|0EDF]a  moratorium on
[NKREA|0EE0]long-range missile tests.


[NKREA|0EE1]As part of
[NKREA|0EE2]the Six-Party process, Pyongyang
[NKREA|0EE3]disabled  some
[NKREA|0EE4]of its plutonium facilities.


[NKREA|0EE5]These partial successes are
[NKREA|0EE6]sometimes cited by those
[NKREA|0EE7]arguing that 
[NKREA|0EE8]convincing North Korea to halt
[NKREA|0EE9]its nuclear and/or missile
[NKREA|0EEA]testing should be
[NKREA|0EEB]the focus of U.S. 
[NKREA|0EEC]diplomatic efforts.


[NKREA|0EED]This approach amounts to an
[NKREA|0EEE]arms control approach, rather
[NKREA|0EEF]than a full denuclearization strategy.


[NKREA|0EF0]It 
[NKREA|0EF1]would require the
[NKREA|0EF2]United States to effectively abandon—either
[NKREA|0EF3]implicitly or explicitly—its 
[NKREA|0EF4]longstanding official goal
[NKREA|0EF5]of achieving complete denuclearization
[NKREA|0EF6]of North Korea, at least
[NKREA|0EF7]in the  short
[NKREA|0EF8]and medium terms.100 Some critics
[NKREA|0EF9]of adopting an arms control
[NKREA|0EFA]approach argue that it
[NKREA|0EFB]would  divert
[NKREA|0EFC]the U.S. focus away from
[NKREA|0EFD]denuclearization, prematurely provide economic benefits
[NKREA|0EFE]to  
[NKREA|0EFF]North Korea, send
[NKREA|0F00]the wrong message to other
[NKREA|0F01]would-be nuclear proliferators,
[NKREA|0F02]and potentially  destabilize
[NKREA|0F03]international relations in East Asia
[NKREA|0F04]by providing incentives
[NKREA|0F05]for South Korea and/or 
[NKREA|0F06]Japan to develop their own
[NKREA|0F07]nuclear weapons.101

[NKREA|0F27]107 For example, in late
[NKREA|0F28]November 2023, Kim Yo Jong,
[NKREA|0F29]Kim Jong Un’s sister
[NKREA|0F2A]and high-ranking Communist Party 
[NKREA|0F2B]official, said North Korea
[NKREA|0F2C]would “never” return to dialogue
[NKREA|0F2D]with the United States
[NKREA|0F2E]so long as
[NKREA|0F2F]the United States
[NKREA|0F30]and its  allies
[NKREA|0F31]continued to “violat[e]” North Korea’s
[NKREA|0F32]sovereignty through such measures
[NKREA|0F33]as seeking to obtain
[NKREA|0F34]a UNSC censure 
[NKREA|0F35]of North Korea’s November 21,
[NKREA|0F36]2023, launch of
[NKREA|0F37]a military spy satellite.


[NKREA|0F38]The launch violated UNSC sanctions
[NKREA|0F39]prohibiting North Korea from
[NKREA|0F3A]conducting launches using ballistic missile
[NKREA|0F3B]technology.


[NKREA|0F3C]Kim Yo Jong
[NKREA|0F3D]also cited the 
[NKREA|0F3E]United States’ “provocative military activities”
[NKREA|0F3F]such as its 2023
[NKREA|0F40]temporary deployments of
[NKREA|0F41]nuclear-armed submarines  to
[NKREA|0F42]South Korea.

[NKREA|0F49]The U.S. deployments
[NKREA|0F4A]of nuclear-capable platforms to South
[NKREA|0F4B]Korea have been part
[NKREA|0F4C]of the U.S. attempt to
[NKREA|0F4D]respond to  South
[NKREA|0F4E]Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol’s push
[NKREA|0F4F]to shore up
[NKREA|0F50]the United States’
[NKREA|0F51]extended deterrence commitments to 
[NKREA|0F52]Many supporters of an aggressive
[NKREA|0F53]engagement strategy also argue that
[NKREA|0F54]the potential for 
[NKREA|0F55]catastrophic loss of life
[NKREA|0F56]if a conflict escalates is
[NKREA|0F57]unacceptable, and diplomacy makes
[NKREA|0F58]a conflict  less
[NKREA|0F59]likely.102 Similarly, others argue that
[NKREA|0F5A]the absence of an active
[NKREA|0F5B]diplomatic process can entail 
[NKREA|0F5C]risks, such as North Korea
[NKREA|0F5D]engaging in nuclear weapons
[NKREA|0F5E]testing or testing long
[NKREA|0F5F]or medium-range  missiles.103
[NKREA|0F60]A 2017 Center
[NKREA|0F61]for Strategic and International Studies
[NKREA|0F62]study found a correlation 
[NKREA|0F63]between U.S.-DPRK diplomacy
[NKREA|0F64]and the decreased
[NKREA|0F65]frequency of North Korean provocations
[NKREA|0F66]between 1990 and 2017,
[NKREA|0F67]though it also
[NKREA|0F68]noted that the absence
[NKREA|0F69]of a provocation did
[NKREA|0F6A]not necessarily  mean
[NKREA|0F6B]that North Korea
[NKREA|0F6C]had halted its weapons development
[NKREA|0F6D]programs.104 Others argue
[NKREA|0F6E]for putting  aside
[NKREA|0F6F]discussions over nuclear
[NKREA|0F70]and missile programs
[NKREA|0F71]and instead focusing
[NKREA|0F72]first on confidence- 
[NKREA|0F73]building measures that
[NKREA|0F74]could reduce the chance
[NKREA|0F75]of military conflict.


[NKREA|0F76]This could include hotlines
[NKREA|0F77]or  other transparency
[NKREA|0F78]measures, such as were
[NKREA|0F79]established between the
[NKREA|0F7A]United States and
[NKREA|0F7B]the Soviet  Union
[NKREA|0F7C]during the Cold War
[NKREA|0F7D]and between India
[NKREA|0F7E]and Pakistan in
[NKREA|0F7F]the past two decades.


[NKREA|0F80]Supporters of  this
[NKREA|0F81]approach emphasize that
[NKREA|0F82]resuming channels of contact
[NKREA|0F83]could at the very least
[NKREA|0F84]reduce the risks 
[NKREA|0F85]of miscalculation and inadvertent escalation
[NKREA|0F86]of a conflict.105 
[NKREA|0F87]Preconditions  
[NKREA|0F88]A key question is
[NKREA|0F89]whether the United States should
[NKREA|0F8A]insist on any preconditions
[NKREA|0F8B]before  negotiations begin,
[NKREA|0F8C]and if so,
[NKREA|0F8D]what they should be.
[NKREA|0F8E]During the 2020 presidential election
[NKREA|0F8F]campaign, then-candidate Biden
[NKREA|0F90]said that he
[NKREA|0F91]would establish preconditions
[NKREA|0F92]before meeting  personally
[NKREA|0F93]with Kim Jong Un,
[NKREA|0F94]including that Kim “agree that
[NKREA|0F95]he would be
[NKREA|0F96]drawing down his 
[NKREA|0F97]nuclear capacity.”106 As
[NKREA|0F98]mentioned earlier, Biden Administration officials
[NKREA|0F99]repeatedly have stated 
[NKREA|0F9A]they will not insist on
[NKREA|0F9B]any preconditions for lower-level diplomatic
[NKREA|0F9C]engagement.


[NKREA|0F9D]North Korea generally
[NKREA|0F9E]has rejected dialogue on denuclearization
[NKREA|0F9F]unless other countries drop their
[NKREA|0FA0]preconditions and take certain steps,
[NKREA|0FA1]such as the
[NKREA|0FA2]United States withdrawing its protection
[NKREA|0FA3]of South  Korea.107
[NKREA|0FA4]In July 2017, China
[NKREA|0FA5]and Russia proposed
[NKREA|0FA6]a “double freezing” approach (often
[NKREA|0FA7]called a  
[NKREA|0FA8]South Korea amidst North Korea’s
[NKREA|0FA9]expanded military capabilities.


[NKREA|0FAA]In the April 2023 Biden-Yoon
[NKREA|0FAB]“Washington  Declaration,”
[NKREA|0FAC]the United States
[NKREA|0FAD]agreed to expand consultations
[NKREA|0FAE]with South Korea on
[NKREA|0FAF]the use of U.S. nuclear
[NKREA|0FB0]weapons on 
[NKREA|0FB1]the Korean Peninsula
[NKREA|0FB2]and to “enhance
[NKREA|0FB3]the regular visibility
[NKREA|0FB4]of strategic assets to
[NKREA|0FB5]the Korean Peninsula.” South Korea
[NKREA|0FB6]also restated its commitment
[NKREA|0FB7]not to develop nuclear weapons.

[NKREA|101A]concrete benefits from Kim in
[NKREA|101B]return.


[NKREA|101C]Some criticized these suspensions,
[NKREA|101D]arguing that they
[NKREA|101E]reduced the readiness
[NKREA|101F]of U.S. and South 
[NKREA|1020]Korean forces to deal
[NKREA|1021]with a DPRK military provocation.


[NKREA|1022]Kim Jong Un
[NKREA|1023]also has criticized U.S. 
[NKREA|1024]sales of major weapons systems
[NKREA|1025]to South Korea.110 
[NKREA|1026]Another possible inducement to North
[NKREA|1027]Korea conceivably could be
[NKREA|1028]the reduction or withdrawal
[NKREA|1029]of 
[NKREA|102A]the roughly 28,500 U.S. forces
[NKREA|102B]stationed in South Korea.


[NKREA|102C]According to multiple accounts, 
[NKREA|102D]President Trump repeatedly
[NKREA|102E]expressed his desire to reduce
[NKREA|102F]or withdraw these forces
[NKREA|1030]during his 
[NKREA|1031]time in office.111
[NKREA|1032]If the topic was
[NKREA|1033]raised during the Trump-Kim meetings
[NKREA|1034]or other interactions, it is
[NKREA|1035]not mentioned in accounts
[NKREA|1036]of those discussions.


[NKREA|1037]In recent national defense authorizations,
[NKREA|1038]the  FY2019 John
[NKREA|1039]S. McCain National Defense Authorization
[NKREA|103A]Act, the FY2020 National Defense
[NKREA|103B]Authorization Act, and
[NKREA|103C]the FY2021 William M. (Mac)
[NKREA|103D]Thornberry National Defense 
[NKREA|103E]Authorization Act (P.L.


[NKREA|103F]115-232, P.L.


[NKREA|1040]116-92, and P.L.


[NKREA|1041]116-283), Congress placed conditions on
[NKREA|1042]the President’s ability to reduce
[NKREA|1043]the U.S. troop presence in
[NKREA|1044]South Korea.112 According to some
[NKREA|1045]accounts, at a June 2000
[NKREA|1046]summit, Kim Jong Un’s father
[NKREA|1047]and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, reportedly
[NKREA|1048]told then-South Korean President Kim
[NKREA|1049]Dae Jung that he was
[NKREA|104A]not opposed to
[NKREA|104B]the continued  presence
[NKREA|104C]of U.S. forces in South
[NKREA|104D]Korea.


[NKREA|104E]Others, however, say that Kim
[NKREA|104F]Jong-il’s comments were 
[NKREA|1050]more ambiguous.113 They
[NKREA|1051]also are juxtaposed against decades
[NKREA|1052]of North Korean official 
[NKREA|1053]pronouncements calling for
[NKREA|1054]the withdrawal of U.S. threats,
[NKREA|1055]including the presence
[NKREA|1056]of U.S. troops 
[NKREA|1057]on the Korean Peninsula.


[NKREA|1058]Format of Negotiations 
[NKREA|1059]The format of U.S.-DPRK negotiations
[NKREA|105A]has varied.


[NKREA|105B]The Agreed Framework was
[NKREA|105C]reached after  months
[NKREA|105D]of bilateral negotiations.


[NKREA|105E]South Korea and Japan,
[NKREA|105F]later followed by
[NKREA|1060]the European Union 
[NKREA|1061]and other countries,
[NKREA|1062]helped to fund
[NKREA|1063]and implement the agreement.


[NKREA|1064]Several rounds of
[NKREA|1065]so-called  “four-party talks”
[NKREA|1066]among China, North Korea, South
[NKREA|1067]Korea, and the
[NKREA|1068]United States were held in
[NKREA|1069]the late 1990s to discuss
[NKREA|106A]negotiating a peace treaty to
[NKREA|106B]replace the 1953 armistice that
[NKREA|106C]ended the  Korean
[NKREA|106D]War.


[NKREA|106E]The Six-Party Talks
[NKREA|106F]also adopted a multilateral format,
[NKREA|1070]but bilateral negotiations, 
[NKREA|1071]including between the
[NKREA|1072]United States and North Korea,
[NKREA|1073]were embedded into
[NKREA|1074]the Six-Party  structure.


[NKREA|1075]The 2011/2012 Leap Day Deal
[NKREA|1076]negotiations were bilateral,
[NKREA|1077]as were the 2018-2019 
[NKREA|1078]Trump-Kim talks, though South Korean
[NKREA|1079]President Moon at times
[NKREA|107A]played an active role
[NKREA|107B]as go- between
[NKREA|107C]and conducted his own parallel
[NKREA|107D]diplomacy with North Korea.


[NKREA|107E]North Korea has
[NKREA|107F]tended to prefer
[NKREA|1080]dealing with the
[NKREA|1081]United States in
[NKREA|1082]a bilateral setting.114
[NKREA|1083]A line of 
[NKREA|1084]communication through the North Korean
[NKREA|1085]mission to the
[NKREA|1086]United Nations—known as “the New
[NKREA|1087]York channel”—has sometimes been used
[NKREA|1088]to explore the possibility
[NKREA|1089]of various proposals.


[NKREA|108A]Unofficial “Track 2” discussions (among
[NKREA|108B]nongovernment officials) and “Track 1.5”
[NKREA|108C]discussions  (among nongovernment
[NKREA|108D]officials and government representatives)
[NKREA|108E]also have been used to
[NKREA|108F]convey  messages
[NKREA|1090]and explore possibilities
[NKREA|1091]for official negotiations
[NKREA|1092]and could be used in
[NKREA|1093]the future.


[NKREA|1094]These  unofficial discussions
[NKREA|1095]generally are held in third
[NKREA|1096]countries, though occasionally U.S. 
[NKREA|1097]Administrations have given permission
[NKREA|1098]for North Koreans to enter
[NKREA|1099]the United States to 
[NKREA|109A]participate.115 Prior to
[NKREA|109B]the Trump Administration, high-profile U.S.
[NKREA|109C]figures such as former 
[NKREA|109D]Presidents Bill Clinton
[NKREA|109E]and Jimmy Carter,
[NKREA|109F]as well as
[NKREA|10A0]a handful of U.S. Members
[NKREA|10A1]of Congress and 
[NKREA|10A2]cabinet members, had
[NKREA|10A3]visited North Korea
[NKREA|10A4]and sought to
[NKREA|10A5]either release detainees
[NKREA|10A6]or further other 
[NKREA|10A7]U.S. goals.

[NKREA|10BC]Distinguishing Between Diplomatic Contacts
[NKREA|10BD]and Formal Negotiations 
[NKREA|10BE]At times, opponents
[NKREA|10BF]of negotiating with North Korea,
[NKREA|10C0]if taken literally,
[NKREA|10C1]can appear to oppose all
[NKREA|10C2]contact with  North
[NKREA|10C3]Korea.


[NKREA|10C4]When discussing diplomatic options, it
[NKREA|10C5]may be useful to distinguish
[NKREA|10C6]between U.S. officials
[NKREA|10C7]holding  discussions
[NKREA|10C8]with North Korean officials
[NKREA|10C9]and entering into formal negotiations.


[NKREA|10CA]Many commentators have
[NKREA|10CB]expressed  concern that
[NKREA|10CC]a lack of any contact
[NKREA|10CD]with the regime in Pyongyang
[NKREA|10CE]heightens the risk
[NKREA|10CF]of inadvertent escalation.


[NKREA|10D0]This  is particularly
[NKREA|10D1]true because of
[NKREA|10D2]how little U.S. analysts
[NKREA|10D3]and officials know about Kim
[NKREA|10D4]Jong Un and his sensitivity
[NKREA|10D5]to  rhetoric from
[NKREA|10D6]Washington.


[NKREA|10D7]By the same token, North
[NKREA|10D8]Koreans likely struggle to interpret
[NKREA|10D9]signals from Washington 
[NKREA|10DA]in light of
[NKREA|10DB]changing U.S. preferences
[NKREA|10DC]and intentions concerning diplomacy
[NKREA|10DD]or military options
[NKREA|10DE]articulated by  different
[NKREA|10DF]U.S. administrations.116  
[NKREA|10E0]After President Trump
[NKREA|10E1]first agreed in March 2018
[NKREA|10E2]to meet with Kim, his
[NKREA|10E3]Administration 
[NKREA|10E4]emphasized the importance
[NKREA|10E5]of developing a strong leader-to-leader
[NKREA|10E6]relationship.


[NKREA|10E7]The strategy 
[NKREA|10E8]presumed better results
[NKREA|10E9]than the working-group negotiations
[NKREA|10EA]employed by previous 
[NKREA|10EB]administrations.


[NKREA|10EC]In practice, the Administration’s approach
[NKREA|10ED]was characterized by, among other
[NKREA|10EE]items, a lack
[NKREA|10EF]of emphasis on
[NKREA|10F0]obtaining concrete agreements
[NKREA|10F1]during working-level negotiations;


[NKREA|10F2]summit meetings often were
[NKREA|10F3]announced before the working-level talks
[NKREA|10F4]had commenced.


[NKREA|10F5]President  Trump
[NKREA|10F6]often spoke and
[NKREA|10F7]acted without regard to his
[NKREA|10F8]working-level team and
[NKREA|10F9]the positions they 
[NKREA|10FA]pushed.


[NKREA|10FB]His penchant for sudden policy
[NKREA|10FC]changes, as well
[NKREA|10FD]as his widely-believed desire to
[NKREA|10FE]hold a  summit
[NKREA|10FF]before substantive issues
[NKREA|1100]had been resolved, further
[NKREA|1101]reduced U.S. diplomats’
[NKREA|1102]bargaining  
[NKREA|1103]leverage.


[NKREA|1104]For their part, North Korea’s
[NKREA|1105]negotiators often appeared to be
[NKREA|1106]waiting for Kim Jong Un
[NKREA|1107]to deal directly
[NKREA|1108]with President Trump.


[NKREA|1109]DPRK diplomats in general
[NKREA|110A]rarely have flexibility to
[NKREA|110B]make  decisions on
[NKREA|110C]their own, requiring frequent consultations
[NKREA|110D]with higher level
[NKREA|110E]officials—including the  supreme
[NKREA|110F]leader—before making commitments.


[NKREA|1110]This dynamic was
[NKREA|1111]accentuated during the Trump- 
[NKREA|1112]Kim rapprochement, where
[NKREA|1113]the two leaders
[NKREA|1114]had announced they
[NKREA|1115]would meet before substantive 
[NKREA|1116]working-level talks had begun.117

[NKREA|114E]Linkage to Other Issues 
[NKREA|114F]In the past,
[NKREA|1150]the United States
[NKREA|1151]has generally focused negotiations on
[NKREA|1152]halting progress on North 
[NKREA|1153]Korea’s nuclear weapons
[NKREA|1154]and missile programs.


[NKREA|1155]Several other contentious issues
[NKREA|1156]could be 
[NKREA|1157]included in a prospective negotiation,
[NKREA|1158]including:  
[NKREA|1159]• North Korea’s chemical
[NKREA|115A]and biological weapons programs;


[NKREA|115B]• North Korean cyber theft
[NKREA|115C]operations and cyberattacks,
[NKREA|115D]the latter of
[NKREA|115E]which the  U.S.
[NKREA|115F]intelligence community assesses
[NKREA|1160]have the potential to cause
[NKREA|1161]temporary  disruptions to
[NKREA|1162]infrastructure networks and business networks
[NKREA|1163]in the United States 
[NKREA|1164]and compromise software supply chains;118
[NKREA|1165]• North Korea’s conventional forces;


[NKREA|1166]• other confidence-building measures, such
[NKREA|1167]as making DPRK
[NKREA|1168]and U.S./ROK forces 
[NKREA|1169]more transparent through initiatives
[NKREA|116A]like exchanging observers;119 
[NKREA|116B]• North Korea’s human rights
[NKREA|116C]conditions, which by U.S. statute
[NKREA|116D]are among the 
[NKREA|116E]factors that must be
[NKREA|116F]incorporated into steps to suspend
[NKREA|1170]or terminate U.S. 
[NKREA|1171]sanctions against North Korea;120 
[NKREA|1172]• steps to normalize U.S.-DPRK
[NKREA|1173]relations, such as
[NKREA|1174]the opening of interests sections
[NKREA|1175]in each other’s capitals;121 
[NKREA|1176]• the signing
[NKREA|1177]of a peace treaty to
[NKREA|1178]formally end the Korean War;


[NKREA|1179]• North Korea’s designation
[NKREA|117A]as a state sponsor
[NKREA|117B]of terrorism;


[NKREA|117C]• North Korea’s
[NKREA|117D]money-laundering and counterfeiting
[NKREA|117E]of U.S. dollars;


[NKREA|117F]• U.S. citizens

[NKREA|1185]relatives;


[NKREA|1186]• the search
