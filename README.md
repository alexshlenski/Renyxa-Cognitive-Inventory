# **RCI Interpreter — README**

## Overview

The **RCI Interpreter** is a deterministic analytical engine designed to operate entirely within an LLM (Large Language Model) session. It processes structured RCI profiles to extract actionable intelligence and support in‑depth analytical tasks.

For a full architectural overview of the Renyxa Cognitive Inventory (RCI) and its analytical methodology, please refer to the  
**[RCI Whitepaper](https://github.com/alexshlenski/Renyxa-Cognitive-Inventory/blob/main/docs/RCI-whitepaper.pdf).**

---

## Key Features

The RCI Interpreter performs the following operations:

- Entity and alias unification

- Action and event extraction

- Timeline, causal chain, and dependency chain construction

- XREF‑grounded reasoning

- Graph‑ready output generation

The Interpreter **does not hallucinate** and does not use external knowledge unless explicitly provided. It operates strictly on structured RCI profile data uploaded by the user.

---

## Compatibility Notice (November 2025)

**Only Kimi K2 (Moonshot AI)** currently supports the deterministic interpreter mode required by RCI.

Recent updates to **OpenAI’s GPT‑5.x lineage** removed the prompt‑controlled deterministic mode formerly available in GPT‑5.0, making GPT‑5.x incompatible with RCI execution.

Because Kimi does not support ODS–IFSN reconciliation, **all automated analysis now runs strictly from the IFSN file**:

- **IFSN** = Machine‑readable, LLM‑driven analysis

- **ODS** = Human‑only analytical reference (not uploaded to Kimi)

- **NRM** = Human‑only provenance and audit document (not uploaded to Kimi)

In future **local LLM deployments**, full ODS/IFSN reconciliation will be restored.

---

## Getting Started

### **1. Start a New Kimi K2 Chat**

- Visit: **[https://kimi.moonshot.cn](https://kimi.moonshot.cn)** (or your enterprise endpoint).

- Create a **new chat session with zero prior context**.  
  Every RCI analysis must begin in a fresh session.

---

### **2. Upload the IFSN Open‑Source Specification**

Upload the following file:

- `/RCI-interpreter/IFSN-open-source-spec.txt`

Drag and drop it into the Kimi chat.  
Kimi will acknowledge receipt.

> **Do not upload ODS, NRM, or any other supporting files.**  
> Uploading unrecognized files may disrupt or impair Interpreter operation.

---

### **3. Upload Your Project‑Specific IFSN File**

Upload the IFSN profile for your project:

- Format: `<project-name>-IFSN.txt`  
  Example: `KENIA-IFSN.txt`

This file contains the structured RCI profile that the Interpreter analyzes.

Kimi will acknowledge upload.

---

### **4. Begin Issuing Interpreter Tasks and Queries**

Once the IFSN spec and your project IFSN file are loaded, you may issue any RCI‑style analytical request.

#### **Example Queries**

- “Create a Mermaid timeline diagram of major events across the entire timeframe.”

- “List all financial transactions over $1,000,000 between December 2004 and January 2009, including sender, receiver, date, and amount.”

- “List all referenced government agencies along with their actions, dates, locations, and taskforce names.”

- “Create dossiers on all individuals flagged for terrorist activity, including known status and last known location.”

---

## **What NOT to Do**

- **Do NOT** upload ODS, NRM, Alias files, or any files other than the IFSN spec and your project IFSN profile.

- **Do NOT** use GPT‑5.x or any GPT model for RCI execution; these models no longer support deterministic control.

- **Do NOT** mix profile sets or upload partial profiles.

- **Do NOT** upload non‑RCI, irrelevant, or unsupported files into the session.

---

## **What is in the Demo Project**

The `/demo` directory contains a sample RCI project illustrating how a full analytical package is structured. Its typical components include:

### **NRM File (`*-NRM.txt`)**

A **normalized source document** with XREF markers for audit, provenance, and transparency.  
It is **never used for automated analysis** and serves exclusively as a **human‑reference document**.

### **ODS File (`*-ODS.json`)**

The **Ontology Driven Scaffolding**, used today only for **human analytical review**.  
It provides a fully structured ontology of the source, enabling manual inspection of the analytical framework.

> In future **local LLM deployments**, the ODS will be restored as an operational component in automated analysis workflows.

### **Aliases File (`*-aliases.txt`)**

Contains the full alias map for entities, organizations, locations, and other elements.  
This ensures **complete symbolic and semantic search coverage**, enabling comprehensive entity unification in human or machine contexts.

### **IFSN File (`*-IFSN.txt`)**

The core machine‑readable semantic profile.  
This is the only **project data file uploaded to Kimi** for automated analysis.

### **/deliverables Folder**

Contains example output generated by earlier RCI Interpreter sessions.  
These may include:

- Structured analytical reports

- Diagrams (e.g., timelines, graphs, relationship charts)

- Event lists

- Entity summaries

These files **demonstrate the analytical capabilities** of the RCI framework using the demo dataset.

## Disclaimers

Renyxa Cognitive Inventory is under continuous development. Analytical logic, specifications, and workflows may evolve. Documentation will be updated as changes occur.

The IFSN open‑source specification enables full analysis of field‑grade RCI profiles derived from HUMINT/OSINT sources.  
Sample canonical profiles are provided in `/demo` for testing.

Creating your own profiles using only the open‑source specs may yield semantically incomplete or logically invalid structures. Such profiles are **not suitable for field analysis**. The Project Owner assumes no responsibility for misuse or resulting damages.
