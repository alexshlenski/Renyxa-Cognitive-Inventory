RENYXA COGNITIVE INVENTORY: FULL INTERPRETER SPECIFICATION

Intended for: (i) LLM, (ii) human analyst.

🔸 NORMALIZED TEXT

Here is the example of normalized text:

[NKREA|1D050]The Agreed Framework
[NKREA|1D051]also laid the 
[NKREA|1D052]groundwork for U.S. energy assistance
[NKREA|1D053]and improved economic
[NKREA|1D054]relations—including the easing 
[NKREA|1D055]of U.S. sanctions.

--------------------------------------

🔸XREFs

In the square brackets you can see what is called Cross-reference Index or XREF
XREF is comprised of the Document ID ("NKREA" in this example) and a HEX index 
separated by a pipe character ( | )

XREF is used for cross-reference between the elements of the registry and the 
source text. The HEX part of XREF is incremented by 1 at each line monotonically 
across the entire file.

XREFs are used to create original document proof provenance of every detail across the Registry. 
Using the XREFs the field analysts can maintain cross-reference between KR layers that represent 
the semantics of the original document and the exact lines of the normalized document, from which
the facts are derived.

------------------------------------------------------
🔸🔸 RCI Cognitive Categories:
------------------------------------------------------

🔸 deixis

Deixis defines the following:

• who presents the facts or tells the story - information about the narrator from the original document and other sources.
• environment - what kind of reality the presented facts are immersed into. 
• when is "now" - the default timeframe, when the presented events took place.
• where is "here" - the primary location that dominates the in the document.
• location     
• environment
• audience 
• language  
• realm - select a proper value from the whitelist below.
 
Realm Whitelist 
 
physical_reality     — material, measurable world   
mythic_symbolic      — sacred, archetypal, ritualized domain   
literary_narrative   — composed or fictional storyworld   
social_institutional — norms, organizations, bureaucracies  
virtual_digital      — networked or simulated environments  
cognitive_interior   — thoughts, memories, imagination  
legal_procedural     — codified rules, cases, processes  
media_space          — mediated public sphere and symbolic flow  

[
  {
    "global_deixis": {
      "narrator": "<info about author or narrator of the story>",
      "timeframe": "<when the story took place: ISO-8601 or phrase>",
      "location": "<Site primary_reference>",

🔸 entity

Definition: 
A static bounded piece of reality, tangible or intangible, which parts are also static 
bounded pieces of reality, not processes or events or properties of things. 

{
  "entity": {
    "primary_reference": "<entity primary reference|ProperName>",
    "full_classification": "<classification hierarchy from entity to this particular realization>",
    "alias_list": [],
    "description": "<entity description (context based)>",
    "xref": "<XREF[]>"
  }
}

🔸 list_object

{
  "list_object": {
    "primary_reference": "<name as used in source>",
    "description": "<what this object is and how it is used>",
    "full_classification": "<taxonomy path>",
    "lists": [
      {
        "list_name": "<list name from source or context>",
        "xref": "<XREF[]>",
        "list_content": [
          "<string item 1>",
          "<string item 2>"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

• field rules
lists is an array of objects; each object has exactly three keys: list_name (string), xref (string), list_content (array of strings).
Every list_content item is a single flat string. There are no limitations to structuring list_content item. 

Example of possible use:

table row → "col1 | col2 | col3"
hierarchy → "Parent > Child > Leaf — text"
timeline → "2008-11 — event text" (year-only OK)

------------------------------------------------------

🔸 aspect

What an Aspect is.
An Aspect is a dependent feature that inheres in a bearer (an entity or an occurrent). 
Aspects let you capture what a thing is like (properties), comes from (lineage), can do (capacities), 
is for (functions), is designated as (roles/offices/memberships), is identified by (codes), and how 
it relates to other entities (relations, dependencies, standing causal influence).
Aspects are not timelines (that’s Occurrents) and not statuses/conditions (that’s State).

Taxonomy:

Aspect > DerivedState (group mood/perceived conditions)
-> SocialCohesion

Aspect > Disposition (latent propensities)
-> ConformitySusceptibility

Aspect > FunctionProfile (capabilities relevant to influence)
-> MobilizationCapacity

H) things that happen (occurrents)

Phenomenon > Process
-> ControlledProcess

Phenomenon > Event 
-> Departure

Aspect > IntrinsicAttribute
-> Color

Aspect > DerivedState
-> Capacity 

Aspect > FunctionProfile (goal-directed capabilities)
-> Reconnaissance

Aspect > Marker
-> VIN 

Aspect > SocialDesignation (roles/offices/responsibilities)
-> Role

Aspect > Relationship (static ties; model changes via Events)
-> MemberOf

modality:
-> observed | documented | alleged | rumored | inferred | estimated
confidence:
-> value(0–1) | method(manual | heuristic | bayes)
polarity:
-> affirmative | negative | uncertain
negation handling:
-> if negative, invert action taxon (used → not_used) rather than storing “not” in data

O) mapping hints (common phrases → canonical paths)

“X sanctioned by Y under Z”
-> ConventionalEntity: SanctionsRegime(Z)
-> Aspect.RelationalAttribute: SanctionedBy(X, Y, Z)
-> Event: sanctionImposed(Y → X, regime=Z, time/site)

“Y supplied weapons to X”
-> Aspect.RelationalAttribute: Supplies(Y → X)
-> Event: transfer/shipment (Process or Event), subjects: Y, objects: Weapon/Ammo, route: Sites, evidence: Carrier(s)

“Court issued a warrant for P”
-> ConventionalEntity: Warrant
-> Event: warrantIssued(Court → Person)
-> Aspect.RelationalAttribute: InvestigatedBy(Person, Agency/Court, CaseCaption)

“Ambassador summoned”
-> Event: summoning(HostGov → Diplomat)
-> Site: MFA or EmbassyPremises
-> Environment: LegalEnvironment + SocialEnvironment (diplomatic context)

“Payment of $N from A to B”
-> Event: payment(A → B, amount, currency, channel=PaymentRail)
-> System: FinancialSystem / PaymentRail
-> Carrier: bank record / SWIFT message / crypto tx id

“Drone strike at Location”
-> Event: droneStrike(attacker, target, Site)
-> Environment: Airspace + ArmedConflict
-> Aspects: CasualtyEvent, DamageLevel, ReadinessLevel updates


1) IntrinsicAttribute
Definition. Current, bearer-dependent properties observable/measurable now without needing a trigger 
or permission.

Mass, density, dimensions (length/width/height/diameter), shape; material (composition/grade); 
mechanical (hardness/elasticity); thermal (operating range); electrical (resistivity/ratings); 
optical (color/reflectance); acoustic signature; morphology/finish (markings/livery, camouflage, insignia). 
For persons/biological: blood type; biometrics (fingerprint/face/iris templates).

2) HistoricalAttribute

Definition. Origin/lineage facts fixed by manufacture or biography; they travel with the exemplar across time.

Design lineage: Make, Model
Manufacture & origin: Factory/Plant, CountryOfOrigin, ProductionDate
Provenance (summary): FirstOwner/Registrant, AcquisitionMethod
Biographic (person): DateOfBirth, PlaceOfBirth, EducationCredential

3) Disposition

Definition. Latent capacities or susceptibilities that manifest under specified triggers or conditions.

4) FunctionProfile

Definition. Designed or learned operating pattern—what the thing or unit is for (objective + performance envelope).

5) SocialDesignation

Definition. Roles, offices, responsibilities, and memberships borne within social/legal regimes; they are labels of 
participation, realized in Activities.

6) Marker

Definition. Identifiers bound to entities for resolution/trace; not addresses and not lineage facts.

7) RelationalAttribute

Definition. Asserted edges between entities. These are standing ties, recorded on the subject with a pointer (relates_to) 
and optional scope/dates. Use them for person↔person ties and other static links. (Person↔organization affiliations are 
SocialDesignation > Membership.)


7a) Dependency (under RelationalAttribute)

Definition. Functional reliance: the subject needs or is provisioned by the target to perform functions or maintain states.
Core forms. depends-on / requires / provided-by / supplies-to / supported-by / supports.

7b) CausalInfluence (under RelationalAttribute)

Definition. Standing claim that the subject modulates the target’s outcomes/risks (outside any single narrated event).

🔸 actuality

Definition: 
actuality is an artificial term to describe any kind of predicate other than a copula.

actuality object reflects the following concepts:

• operative_verb — normalized predicate in dot-path form.
• participants list — the references to all entity objects that describe all entities participating in actuality. 

Operative Verb Structure

• Format:

<Category>.<Subcategory>.<SpecificVerb>

• Examples:

Negotiate.Denuclearization.Partial
Propose.Restore.Communication
Reject.Aid.Offer
Enforce.Sanction.Trade
Deploy.Military.Unit

actuality JSON Object:

The object has a "verbatim" field, which receives exactly one sentence from the source text verbatim.
The "normalized" field recieves the same sentence after normalization. Nominalization Rewriting Rule must be 
applied to the verbatim sentence to surface additional semantics. The result should populate the "normalized" 
field.

  "actuality": {
    "deixis": { // optional, populate only if the deixis is different from Global deixis.
      "narrator": "<info about author or narrator of the sentence>",
